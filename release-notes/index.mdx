### Ticket Template Branching & Customization

Create company-specific versions of your ticket templates without duplicating the entire template. Branches let you customize templates for individual clients while maintaining a single parent template for everyone else.

**Key Features:**
- **Company Branches**: Create a full copy of any template customized for a specific company with different fields, labels, or PSA routing
- **Independent Editing**: Each branch is fully editable—add sections, modify fields, change help text, or configure different PSA defaults
- **Smart Visibility**: Control which companies can see which templates, with bulk actions and default visibility for new companies
- **Branch Indicators**: Easily identify templates with branches in the templates list with expandable rows showing all company branches

**Use Cases:**
- Customize a "New Employee Setup" template with client-specific software requirements
- Route tickets to different PSA boards or queues per company
- Simplify templates for clients who need fewer fields
- Use different terminology for different industries

---

### Template Import & Export

Export and import ticket templates in JSON or CSV format for backup, sharing, and bulk editing.

**JSON Format:**
- Complete template backup including sections, fields, rules, and PSA settings
- Optionally include company branches in the export
- **Diff Preview**: When importing to an existing template, see exactly what will change—added fields in green, modified in yellow, removed in red
- Import options: Replace existing, create new, or generate a new key to avoid conflicts

**CSV Format:**
- Spreadsheet-friendly format for bulk editing field labels, help text, and options
- Edit in Excel or Google Sheets, then re-import to apply changes
- Preserves template structure while updating field properties

<Tip>
Export templates to JSON before making major changes. You can always import the backup to restore the previous version if needed.
</Tip>

---

### Enhanced Company Visibility Controls

Fine-grained control over which companies can access each template.

**New Features:**
- **Default Visibility Setting**: Configure whether new companies automatically have access to a template or must be manually enabled
- **Enable All Except Branched**: One-click action to enable a template for all companies that don't have a custom branch (perfect when using branching)
- **Branch Indicators**: Companies with branches are highlighted so you know they'll use their branch version
- **Bulk Actions**: Enable All, Disable All, and smart filtering options

---

### Improvements
