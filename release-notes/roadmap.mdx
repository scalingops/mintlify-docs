We're constantly working to improve MSPortal.ai. Here's what's on our roadmap:

## Planned Features

### User Statistics Dashboard
Track how many compliance checks are completed across tenants to support KPI and accountability reporting.

### Automatic QBR Scheduling
Send a scheduling link so clients can pick times that work for them—no more back-and-forth.

### vCIO and Technician Capacity Planning
Forecast workload and balance team capacity for upcoming quarters.

### Client Invoice Viewing
Allow clients to securely view their invoices in the portal.

### Projects Dashboard
Centralized view of project status, blockers, and owners.
