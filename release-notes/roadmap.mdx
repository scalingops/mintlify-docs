We're constantly working to improve MSPortal.ai. Here's what's on our roadmap:

## In Active Development

### Automation Rules

A powerful rules engine for automating tasks across MSPortal.ai. Create rules with conditions and actions to auto-populate planner items, send notifications, create tickets, and more—all based on events like warranty expirations, compliance check failures, or scheduled triggers.

**Preview of capabilities:**
- Create rules with multiple conditions and actions
- Trigger automations based on events like ticket creation, compliance check updates, or scheduled times
- Automated notifications and task creation
- Server-side search for company selection in rule conditions

<Note>
The infrastructure is in place with a multi-step wizard editor for creating rules, condition builders, and action configurations. This feature will be enabled for all users soon—stay tuned for the official launch!
