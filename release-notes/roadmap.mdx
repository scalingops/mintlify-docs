## Coming February 27

### Customer Success System

A comprehensive customer health and success platform that tells you exactly where to focus your resources. The Customer Success system continuously monitors every dimension of your client relationships and surfaces the accounts that need attention before small issues become big problems.

**Health Scoring Across 8 Dimensions:**
- **Service Quality** - Ticket volume, average resolution time, reopen rates, and escalation percentages
- **Engagement** - Meeting recency, missed meeting rates, NPS scores, QBR scheduling, and days since last contact
- **Financial Health** - Invoice status, overdue counts, outstanding balances, average days to pay, and payment recency
- **Sales Pipeline** - Quote recency, win rates, and open opportunity values
- **Projects** - Active projects, year-to-date project count, and project velocity
- **Tool Stack** - Deployment percentage of required and recommended tools across your client base
- **Environment** - Device counts, active users, and compliance check coverage
- **Operational** - Overdue planner items, overdue compliance checks, and goal completion rates

**Risk Classification:**
Every company is categorized as Thriving, Healthy, At Risk, or Critical with trend indicators showing whether they're improving, stable, or declining.

**Portfolio Summary:**
See your entire book of business at a glance - average health scores, risk distribution, NPS trends, overdue invoices, and engagement gaps across all clients.

### Financial Reporting

A dedicated financial area that gives MSPs clear visibility into the profitability of every client relationship.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Managed Revenue** - Recurring revenue from managed service contracts
- **Support Hours** - Time spent on reactive support from configured service boards
- **Managed Endpoints** - Device or user counts based on your chosen endpoint model
- **Reactive Hours per Endpoint (RHEM)** - Support hours divided by managed endpoints - see how much reactive work each endpoint generates
- **Effective Hourly Rate (EHR)** - Managed revenue divided by support hours - know what you're actually earning per hour
- **All-in Seat Price** - Managed revenue divided by managed endpoints - your true per-seat economics

**Financial Grading:**
Each client receives an A-F letter grade based on RHEM, EHR, and all-in seat price so you can instantly spot your most and least profitable accounts.

**Flexible Reporting Periods:**
View metrics for the current month, trailing 3 months, year-to-date, or any specific historical month - all normalized to monthly averages for fair comparison.
