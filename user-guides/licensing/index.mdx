The Licensing module connects MSPortal.ai to your [Pax8](https://www.pax8.com) distributor account, giving you centralized control over software subscriptions, product catalogs, and client self-service license management. MSPs can configure approval workflows, control which products clients can see, and set per-subscription rules for self-service quantity changes.

<Note>
  The Licensing module requires an active Pax8 integration. See [Set Up Pax8 Integration](/user-guides/licensing/setup) to get started.

## Prerequisites

- An active [Pax8](https://www.pax8.com) partner account
- The **Pax8 integration** configured in MSPortal.ai (see [Set Up Pax8 Integration](/user-guides/licensing/setup))
- The **manage_licensing** permission to configure settings
- At least one Pax8 company mapped to an MSPortal company

---

## Licensing Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Licensing** to access three configuration tabs: **Approval**, **Catalog**, and **Self-Service**.

<Info>
  All three tabs require an active Pax8 integration. If no integration is connected, you'll see a prompt to set one up in **Settings > Integrations**.
</Info>

### Approval Settings

The Approval tab controls when license quantity changes require your review before they take effect.

#### Global Approval Setting

Toggle **Require Approval by Default** to control whether all quantity change requests need MSP approval before processing.

- **Enabled**: All client-initiated quantity changes are held for your approval
- **Disabled**: Changes are applied automatically (subject to threshold rules)

#### Auto-Approve Threshold

Set a percentage threshold that determines when changes are auto-approved versus held for review.

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **50%** | A change from 10 to 15 licenses (50% increase) auto-approves. A change from 10 to 16+ requires approval. |
| **25%** | Only small changes (up to 25% of current quantity) auto-approve |
| **0%** | All changes require manual approval |

<Tip>
  Start with a conservative threshold (e.g., 25%) and adjust based on your comfort level with automatic changes.
</Tip>

#### Vendor-Specific Overrides

Click vendor badges to mark specific vendors that **always require approval**, regardless of the global setting or threshold. This is useful for high-value or sensitive products.

For example, you might allow auto-approval for most products but always require approval for Microsoft 365 license changes.

---

### Catalog Settings

The Catalog tab controls which Pax8 products are visible to clients in the self-service portal and which products appear as featured.

#### Product Table

The table lists all synced Pax8 products with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product Name** | The product name from Pax8 |
| **Vendor** | The software vendor |
| **Category** | Product category |
| **Retail Price** | Listed retail price |
| **Visible** | Toggle to show/hide the product from clients |
| **Featured** | Star icon to mark a product as featured (appears first in self-service) |

#### Managing Visibility

- **Show/Hide individually**: Toggle the visibility switch on any product row
- **Bulk actions**: Select multiple products using checkboxes, then use the bulk action dropdown to **Show**, **Hide**, **Feature**, or **Unfeature** selected products
- **Filter**: Use the vendor, category, and visibility filters to find specific products
- **Search**: Search by product name

<Warning>
  Hidden products are not visible to clients in the self-service portal. Hiding a product does not cancel existing subscriptions for that product.
</Warning>

#### Featured Products

Mark products as **Featured** to highlight them at the top of the client self-service catalog. Use this for products you want to promote or that clients frequently request.

---

### Self-Service Settings

The Self-Service tab controls what clients can do with their subscriptions without contacting your team.

#### Global Defaults

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allow Self-Service by Default** | Whether clients can request quantity changes on subscriptions |
| **Default Min Quantity** | Minimum number of licenses a client can reduce to |
| **Default Max Quantity** | Maximum number of licenses a client can increase to |

#### Per-Subscription Rules

Override global defaults for individual subscriptions by clicking on a subscription in the table:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Allow Quantity Changes** | Enable or disable self-service for this specific subscription |
| **Require Approval** | Whether changes to this subscription always need MSP approval |
| **Min Quantity** | Minimum license count for this subscription |
| **Max Quantity** | Maximum license count for this subscription |

The edit dialog shows the current quantity for reference, helping you set appropriate min/max limits.

<Tip>
  Use the search bar to quickly find subscriptions by product name, vendor, or company.
</Tip>

## How Sync Works

After Pax8 is connected, data syncs automatically:

| Data Type | Sync Frequency |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Companies** | Every 4 hours |
| **Subscriptions** | Hourly |
| **Products** | Daily (3 AM) |
| **Azure Usage** | Daily (4 AM) |

<Note>
  Only subscriptions belonging to **mapped companies** are synced. If a Pax8 company isn't mapped to an MSPortal company, its subscriptions won't appear in the Licensing module.
</Note>

You can trigger a manual sync at any time from **Settings > Integrations** on the Pax8 card.

---

## Client Self-Service Experience

When self-service is enabled, clients can view their active subscriptions and request quantity changes:

1. Client navigates to the Licensing section
2. They see their active subscriptions with product name, vendor, and current quantity
3. For subscriptions where self-service is allowed, a **Request Change** option is available
4. Client enters their desired quantity (validated against min/max limits)
5. Depending on your configuration:
   - **Auto-approved**: Change applies immediately
   - **Pending approval**: Request is submitted for MSP review

---

## Approving Requests

When a client submits a quantity change that requires approval:

1. The request appears in the Licensing module with a **Pending** status
2. Review the request details: company, product, current quantity, requested quantity
3. **Approve** to apply the change (synced to Pax8 automatically) or **Reject** with an optional reason
4. The client is notified of the outcome

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| **manage_licensing** | Full access: configure approval, catalog, self-service settings; approve/reject requests; trigger syncs |
| **write_licensing** | Client-level: request quantity changes on allowed subscriptions |
