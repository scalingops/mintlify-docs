Financial Reporting Settings let you control how PSA data is classified into revenue categories and how profitability metrics are calculated. The settings page has two tabs: **Revenue Categories** and **Reporting Model**.

## Accessing Financial Reporting Settings

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Under the **MSP Tools** group, select **Financial Reporting**

## Revenue Categories Tab

The Revenue Categories tab maps your PSA product types and billing items to revenue categories. This classification drives all financial metrics and grading.

### Revenue Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Managed Recurring** | Recurring revenue from managed service contracts (e.g., per-seat agreements, monthly monitoring) |
| **Non-Recurring** | One-time or project-based revenue (e.g., hardware sales, migration projects) |
| **Other Recurring** | Other recurring revenue that is not core managed services (e.g., software resale, support plans) |
| **Product Revenue** | Revenue from product sales |

### Configuring Mappings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Financial Reporting settings">
    Go to **Settings > MSP Tools > Financial Reporting** and select the **Revenue Categories** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review detected classifications">
    The page shows product types or billing item types automatically detected from your connected PSA integration, grouped by provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign revenue categories">
    For each product type, select the appropriate revenue category from the dropdown. Items left as **Uncategorized** are excluded from financial calculations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your mappings">
    Click **Save** to apply the changes. Financial metrics will reflect the new mappings on the next data refresh.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Summary Cards

Three summary cards at the top of the tab show:

- **Total Types** - Total number of detected product type classifications
- **Categorized** - How many have been assigned a revenue category
- **Uncategorized** - How many still need to be mapped (shown as a warning if greater than zero)

### PSA-Specific Classifications

The classification structure varies by PSA provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ConnectWise">
    ConnectWise uses **Product Types** and **Product Classes** to categorize billing items. The settings page shows all detected type/class combinations with item counts.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Autotask">
    Autotask uses **Billing Item Types** and **Sub Types** to categorize line items. The settings page shows all detected type/sub-type combinations with item counts.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Halo PSA">
    Halo PSA uses **Asset Type Names** to categorize recurring items. The settings page shows all detected asset types with item counts.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Revenue category mappings must be configured before Financial Reporting shows meaningful data. Without mappings, the system cannot distinguish managed revenue from project revenue.
</Warning>

## Reporting Model Tab

The Reporting Model tab configures how endpoints are counted and how financial profitability thresholds are set.

### Target Seat Price

Set a custom target for your all-in seat price. This adjusts the grade thresholds used in financial scoring.

| Grade | Default Threshold | With Custom Target |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| **A** | $200+ | Scales based on target |
| **B** | $150+ | Scales based on target |
| **C** | $100+ | Scales based on target |
| **D** | $75+ | Scales based on target |
| **F** | Below $75 | Scales based on target |

<Tip>
Leave this blank to use the default thresholds. Set a custom value if your market or service model has different pricing norms.
</Tip>

### Endpoint Model

Choose how endpoints are counted for per-seat calculations. This affects **Reactive Hrs/Endpoint** and **All-in Seat Price** metrics.

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Per Device** | Count managed devices as endpoints |
| **Per User** | Count users associated with each company |
| **Hybrid** | Set endpoint counting rules per company type |

#### Hybrid Endpoint Rules

When using the Hybrid model, you can set different counting methods for different company types:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Hybrid as the endpoint model">
    Choose **Hybrid** from the endpoint model options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a default fallback">
    Select the default endpoint source for company types without a specific rule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure per-type rules">
    For each company type (pulled from your PSA), select the endpoint source:
    - **Use Default** - Falls back to the default setting
    - **Per Device** - Count devices for this company type
    - **Per User** - Count users for this company type
    - **Greater of Both** - Use whichever count is higher
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Hybrid mode is useful when you have a mix of company types. For example, you might count per-device for companies with large device fleets but per-user for companies where you manage user-based services.
</Tip>

### Managed Device Types

When using Per Device or Hybrid endpoint models, select which device types count as managed endpoints.

Only devices matching the selected types are included in per-endpoint calculations. This lets you exclude device types that are not part of your managed services (e.g., network infrastructure, printers).

### Support Hour Boards

Select which PSA service boards contribute to the **Support Hours** metric. Only time entries from selected boards count as reactive support hours.

<Tip>
Select only your reactive support boards. Exclude project boards, internal boards, and pre-sales boards to get an accurate picture of break/fix support costs.
</Tip>
