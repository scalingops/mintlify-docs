The onboarding settings area is where you build and manage onboarding templates, checklist templates, and configure portal defaults.

<Note>
Client onboarding must be enabled at the tenant level before these settings appear. Contact your account administrator to enable it.

## Accessing Onboarding Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Onboarding**. The settings area has two tabs:

### Templates Tab

Manage your onboarding templates:

- **View all templates** with name, description, phase count, and task count
- **Create new templates** with the template builder
- **Edit existing templates** to update phases and tasks
- **Duplicate templates** to create variants
- **Archive/unarchive templates** to manage your library
- **Import/export templates** as JSON for backup or sharing

See the [Templates guide](/user-guides/client-onboarding/templates) for detailed instructions on building templates.

### Checklists Tab

Manage reusable checklist templates:

- **Create checklists** with named items that can be attached to any task
- **Edit checklist items** — add, remove, or reorder items
- **Archive checklists** you no longer need

Checklists are attached to tasks in the template builder and appear as checkable sub-items during onboarding.
