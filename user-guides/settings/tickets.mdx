Ticket Settings control how MSPortal.ai handles tickets from your PSA system. Configure delivery methods, organize tickets into display groups, and define which statuses users can set.

## Accessing Ticket Settings

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Select the **Tickets** icon from the settings navigation

## General Settings

The General tab contains core ticket configuration options.

### Ticket Delivery Method

Choose how tickets are delivered to end users:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Email** | Tickets sent via email notifications |
| **Portal** | Users access tickets through the MSPortal interface |
| **Both** | Tickets available via email and portal |

### Ticket Categories

Define categories to organize tickets by type:

- **Support** - General technical support requests
- **Service Request** - New service requests and changes
- **Incident** - Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Project** - Project-related tasks and milestones

<Note>
Categories sync with your PSA system. Changes here will affect how tickets are categorized across both platforms.
</Note>

### Default Settings

Configure default values for new tickets:

- **Default Priority** - Initial priority level for new tickets
- **Default Status** - Starting status when tickets are created
- **Default Assignment** - Auto-assignment rules

## Display Groups

Display Groups organize how tickets appear in the MSPortal interface. This helps users quickly find relevant tickets.

### Creating Display Groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Group">
    Select the **+ Add Display Group** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Group">
    Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Critical Issues", "Pending Approval")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Filter Criteria">
    Define which tickets appear in this group based on status, priority, or type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Display Order">
    Drag groups to reorder how they appear in the tickets view
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Display Group Examples

| Group Name | Filter Criteria | Use Case |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Open Tickets** | Status = Open | All active tickets |
| **Awaiting Response** | Status = Waiting on Customer | Tickets needing customer input |
| **Escalated** | Priority = Critical | High-priority issues |
| **Scheduled** | Status = Scheduled | Planned work |

## Allowed Statuses

Control which ticket statuses users can select when updating tickets. This ensures consistent status usage across your team.

### Configuring Allowed Statuses

1. Review the list of available statuses from your PSA
2. Check the statuses you want users to be able to select
3. Uncheck statuses that should be restricted (e.g., internal-only statuses)

### Status Categories

Statuses are typically organized by workflow stage:

- **Open Statuses** - New, In Progress, Researching
- **Pending Statuses** - Waiting on Customer, Waiting on Vendor, Scheduled
- **Resolved Statuses** - Resolved, Completed, Closed
- **Cancelled Statuses** - Cancelled, Duplicate

<Warning>
Restricting statuses affects all users. Ensure your team understands which statuses are available before making changes.
</Warning>

## PSA Integration Notes

Ticket settings work in conjunction with your PSA integration:

- **Halo PSA** - Syncs ticket types, statuses, and priorities automatically
- **ConnectWise** - Maps to service board configurations
- **Autotask** - Syncs with ticket categories and queues
- **Syncro** - Integrates with ticket types and statuses

<Note>
Some settings may be overridden by your PSA configuration. Check your [integration settings](/user-guides/integrations/index) if tickets aren't displaying as expected.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults** - Use standard configurations before customizing
2. **Test with a few users** - Validate settings work before rolling out broadly
3. **Document changes** - Keep track of display group configurations
4. **Sync regularly** - Ensure PSA changes are reflected in MSPortal
