### Understanding Roles

Roles define what actions users can perform in MSPortal.ai. Each role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users.

<Note>
The **Primary Admin** role is a system role that cannot be deleted or modified. It always has full access to all features.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Role">
    Select the **+ Add Role** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Role">
    Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Support Technician", "Account Manager")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions">
    Check the permissions this role should have access to
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Role">
    Click **Save** to create the role
  </Step>
</Steps>

### RBAC Permissions

Roles use a granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Each role has three permission levels for every resource:

| Permission Level | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Read** | View data and access the page |
| **Write** | Create and edit records |
| **Manage** | Full control including delete and settings |

### Permission Sections

Permissions are organized into three sections:

**Main Navigation** - Access to core application pages:
- Dashboard, Surveys, Goals, Planner, Budgets
- Calendar, Meetings, Notifications
- M365, Tickets, Compliance, Training
- Devices, Reporting, External

**Settings** - Access to configuration areas:
- Users, Roles, Companies
- Training, Tickets, Compliance settings
- Templates, Playbooks, Integrations
- Import/Export, Tenant, Billing

**Other** - Special permissions:
- Impersonate (start user impersonation)
- Types management

### Role Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Default Role** | Automatically assign to new users |
| **Bypass Company Restrictions** | Access all companies regardless of tenant restrictions |

### Example Role Configurations

| Role Name | Typical Permissions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Support Tech** | Read/Write on Tickets, Devices; Read on Company Overview |
| **Account Manager** | Manage on Calendar, Budgets; Read/Write on Reports |
| **Compliance Admin** | Manage on Compliance, Playbooks; Read on Reports |
| **Training Admin** | Manage on Training; Read on Company Overview |

## Company Assignments

When "Restrict to Assigned Companies" is enabled in [Tenant Settings](/user-guides/settings/tenant), users only see data for companies they're assigned to.

### Assigning Companies to Users

1. Edit a user from the Users tab
2. Navigate to the **Company Assignments** section
3. Select the companies this user should have access to
4. Save changes

<Warning>
If a user has no company assignments when restrictions are enabled, they won't be able to see any company data.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Role Design
- **Start simple** - Create a few broad roles before adding specialized ones
- **Use descriptive names** - Role names should indicate the user's function
- **Document permissions** - Maintain a reference of what each role can do

### User Management
- **Regular audits** - Review user access periodically
- **Deactivate vs delete** - Deactivate users who leave to preserve audit trails
- **Least privilege** - Assign the minimum permissions needed for each role

## Troubleshooting

### User Can't Access a Feature
1. Check the user's assigned role
2. Verify the role has the required permission
3. If using company restrictions, ensure the user is assigned to relevant companies

### Role Changes Not Taking Effect
1. Ask the user to log out and back in
2. Clear browser cache if issues persist
3. Verify the role was saved successfully
