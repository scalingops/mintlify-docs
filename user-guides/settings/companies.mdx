## Roles Tab

The Roles tab lets you define **organizational job titles** for your company users, such as "Account Manager", "Technician", or "Help Desk".

<Warning>
**Roles are not the same as Permissions.** Roles are simple labels that describe a person's job function. They do **not** control what a user can see or do — that is handled by [Permission Groups](#permissions-tab). See [Understanding the Difference](#understanding-the-difference-roles-vs-permissions) below.
</Warning>

### What Roles Are For

Roles help you categorize and organize company users by their job function. They are useful for:

- **Reporting** - Filter and group users by role in reports
- **Organization** - Quickly understand who does what at each company
- **Communication** - Identify the right contact for different types of issues

### Managing Roles

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Role Name** | The name of the role (e.g., "Account Manager") |
| **Description** | Optional description of the role's purpose |

### Creating a Role

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Role">
    Select the **Add Role** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Provide a role name and optional description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the role.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Roles can be edited or deleted from the actions column in the table.

## Permissions Tab

The Permissions tab is where you create and manage **Permission Groups** that control what company users can access and do within their company's portal.

### What Permission Groups Control

Permission groups determine:

- **Which modules** a company user can see (Tickets, Training, Devices, Compliance, etc.)
- **What actions** they can take within each module (Read, Write, or Manage)
- **Which ticket display groups** they have access to

### Permission Levels

Each module supports three levels of access:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Read** | View data only |
| **Write** | Create and edit records |
| **Manage** | Full control including delete |

<Tip>
Selecting **Manage** automatically enables Read and Write for that module. Selecting **Write** automatically enables Read.
</Tip>

### Global vs Custom Groups

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Global** | Built-in permission groups provided by MSPortal. These can be viewed but not edited or deleted. |
| **Custom** | Permission groups you create. Fully editable and deletable. |

### Creating a Permission Group

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Permission Group">
    Select the **Create Permission Group** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Describe">
    Enter a name (e.g., "Standard User") and optional description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Check the permissions for each module. Permissions are organized by resource (Tickets, Meetings, Goals, Training, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set as Default (Optional)">
    Enable **Default Role** if this group should be automatically assigned to new company users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Ticket Display Group (Optional)">
    Select which ticket display group this permission group has access to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the permission group.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Permission Group Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full Access" icon="lock-open">

## Understanding the Difference: Roles vs Permissions

This is an important distinction that affects how you organize and secure your company users.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Roles">
    ### Company Roles

    **Purpose:** Describe who someone is — their job function.

    - Simple labels with a name and description
    - Used for organization, reporting, and identification
    - Do **not** grant or restrict any access
    - Examples: "Account Manager", "Technician", "Help Desk", "CFO"

    **Think of it as:** A job title on a business card.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Permission Groups">
    ### Permission Groups

    **Purpose:** Control what someone can do in the portal.

    - Define module-level access (Read, Write, Manage)
    - Control which features and data a user can see
    - Include ticket display group assignments
    - Examples: "Full Access", "Standard User", "Training Only", "View Only"

    **Think of it as:** A security badge that opens specific doors.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How They Work Together

A company user is assigned **both** a Role and a Permission Group:

| Concept | Set In | Controls | Example |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Role** | Roles tab | Organization and reporting | "Account Manager" |
| **Permission Group** | Permissions tab | Portal access and actions | "Full Access" |

For example, a user might have the role **Account Manager** (describing their job) and the permission group **Full Access** (granting them access to all modules). Another user might also be an **Account Manager** but with a **View Only** permission group if they only need to review information.

<Note>
Roles and Permission Groups are independent. Changing a user's role does not affect their permissions, and changing their permission group does not affect their role.
</Note>

## Required Permissions

To manage Companies Settings, your tenant role needs:

| Permission Level | Capabilities |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Read** (`read_settings_companies`) | View companies, users, roles, and permission groups |
| **Write** (`write_settings_companies`) | Create and edit companies, users, roles, and permission groups |
| **Manage** (`manage_settings_companies`) | All of the above, plus delete |

## Best Practices

- **Start with fewer permission groups** - Create broad groups first, then add specific ones as needed
- **Use roles for reporting** - Assign roles consistently to enable useful reporting by job function
- **Review permissions regularly** - Audit permission groups periodically to ensure appropriate access
- **Keep company data current** - Regularly update company details and verify contacts
- **Use consistent naming** - Establish naming conventions for companies, roles, and permission groups
