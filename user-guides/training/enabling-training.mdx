<Note>
Billing for premium training is calculated per user at enabled companies. When you enable Premium Training for a company, all users at that company will have access to premium courses.
</Note>

## Step 2: Manage Available Courses

After enabling training for companies, configure which courses are available.

### Navigate to Training Settings

Go to **Settings** > **Training** from the main menu.

</Frame>

This page displays all available courses with:
- **Enabled** toggle - Whether the course is available to users
- **Course Title** - Name and description of the course
- **Type** - Premium (Bigger Brains) or Standard
- **Category** - Course topic area
- **Tags** - Additional labels for filtering
- **Duration** - Expected completion time
- **Enrollments** - Number of users assigned

### Enable Individual Courses

1. Browse the course list
2. Click the **Toggle** button next to each course you want to enable
3. The course will become available to users at enabled companies

### Course Filters and Search

- Use the **Search** bar to find courses by title or description
- Filter by **Category** to view courses by topic
- Filter by **Type** to see only Premium or Standard courses

### Create Custom Courses

Click **Create Course** to add your own training content alongside the standard library.

## After Enabling Training

Once training is configured:

1. **Assign Courses** - Go to Training > Assignments to assign courses to users
2. **Set Requirements** - Configure which courses are mandatory vs. optional
3. **Schedule Reminders** - Set up automated reminder emails
4. **Monitor Progress** - Track completion rates in the Training Dashboard

## Best Practices

- **Start Small** - Enable a few essential courses first
- **Communicate** - Inform users before assigning mandatory training
- **Set Deadlines** - Give reasonable time for course completion
- **Regular Updates** - Review and update course selections quarterly
- **Track Metrics** - Monitor completion rates and adjust as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Premium Courses Not Available
