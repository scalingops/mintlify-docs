## Learning Path Settings

### Mandatory Training

When a Learning Path is marked as **Mandatory**:

- Assigned users receive notifications about required training
- Progress is tracked in compliance reports
- Managers can view mandatory training completion status

### Target Roles and Departments

Use targeting to automatically assign training:

- **Target Roles** - Users with matching roles are automatically assigned
- **Target Departments** - Users in matching departments are automatically assigned
- Users can match either criteria to receive the training

## User Groups

User Groups simplify bulk assignments by allowing you to create named collections of users.

### Creating a User Group

1. Navigate to **Learning Paths > User Groups** tab
2. Click **Create Group**
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "New Hires Q1")
4. Add users to the group
5. Click **Save**

### Using Groups in Assignments

When assigning users to a Learning Path, switch to the **Groups** tab to see all available groups. Selecting a group assigns all members at once.

## Best Practices

<Check>
- **Logical Grouping** - Group courses by topic or compliance requirement
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Order courses from foundational to advanced
- **Regular Updates** - Review and update learning paths quarterly
- **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive names like "2024 Security Awareness Training"
- **Use Groups** - Create user groups for common assignment patterns
</Check>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Users not seeing assigned courses">
    **Symptoms:** Users report they don't see courses from an assigned Learning Path.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify the user is in the Assignments list
    2. Check that courses are added to the Learning Path
    3. Ensure the user has access to Training module

    **Prevention:** Test assignments with a sample user before bulk rollout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot create Learning Path">
    **Symptoms:** Create button is disabled or shows error.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify you have **Write Training** permission
    2. Check that Title field is not empty
    3. Select a company if not using Tenant-Wide option

    **Prevention:** Ensure proper permissions are assigned to training administrators.
