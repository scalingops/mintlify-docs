Tool Stack gives you a bird's-eye view of which tools each company in your portfolio has deployed. Define your recommended technology stack, then track deployment status across all companies using a compliance matrix that automatically creates planner items for tracking.

## Setting Up Your Tool Stack

Before using the compliance matrix, you need to define the categories and tools you want to track.

### Managing Categories

Navigate to **Settings > MSP Tools > Tool Stack** to manage your tool stack.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a category">
    Click **Add Category** to create a new tool category (e.g., Security, Backup, Cloud, Monitoring).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the category">
    Click the edit button on the category header to set:
    - **Description** - Optional description of what this category covers
    - **Planner Type** - Links to a planner item type for automatic categorization of created tasks
    - **Icon** - Choose an icon to represent this category
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add tools to the category">
    Click **Add Item** within the category to create individual tool entries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Tool Items

Each tool item has the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The name of the tool (e.g., "SentinelOne EDR", "Veeam Backup") |
| **Vendor** | The vendor name (e.g., "SentinelOne", "Veeam") |
| **Description** | Optional description of the tool's purpose |
| **Default Price** | The default cost used when creating planner items (shown as a dollar amount) |
| **Required** | Whether this tool is mandatory for all companies |

<Tip>
Mark tools as **Required** when they're part of your standard stack that every company should have. Only required tools count toward the Tool Stack health dimension score.
</Tip>

The settings page shows summary counters at the top:
- Total number of categories
- Total number of items
- Number of required items

### Syncing to Companies

After defining your tool stack, you need to sync it to your companies to create tracking records.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Sync All Companies">
    Click the **Sync All Companies** button at the top of the Tool Stack settings page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the confirmation">
    A dialog shows what will happen:
    - How many items across how many categories will be synced
    - Existing company statuses (deployed, in progress, etc.) will **not** be overwritten
    - A planner item is created for each new tracking row
    - The sync runs as a background task
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the sync">
    Click **Sync All Companies** in the dialog to start the background task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Syncing is non-destructive. It only creates new tracking records and planner items where they don't already exist. Companies that already have a status for a tool will not be affected.
</Note>

New tool items are also automatically synced to companies when you add them.

## Using the Compliance Matrix

The compliance matrix is accessed from the **Planner** section in the sidebar, under the **Tool Stack** tab.

### Reading the Matrix

The matrix displays:

- **Rows** - One row per company
- **Columns** - Tool items grouped by category (category names appear as group headers)
- **Cells** - Color-coded status indicators

### Status Indicators

Each cell shows one of four statuses:

| Status | Symbol | Color | Meaning |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Deployed** | Checkmark | Green | Tool is fully deployed and operational |
| **In Progress** | Circle | Amber | Deployment is underway |
| **Not Started** | X | Gray | Tool has not been deployed yet |
| **N/A** | Dash | Light gray | Tool is not applicable to this company |

### Summary Statistics

At the top of the matrix, summary statistics show:
- Total number of companies being tracked
- Overall deployment percentage across all companies
- Count of deployed items vs total items

### Updating Statuses

To change a tool's deployment status for a company:

1. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) the cell you want to update
2. Select from the context menu:
   - **Mark Deployed** - Tool is fully deployed
   - **Mark In Progress** - Deployment has started
   - **Mark Not Started** - Reset to not started
   - **Mark N/A** - Mark as not applicable

A success toast confirms the update: "Marked as [status]".

### Searching Companies

Use the search field at the top of the matrix (placeholder: "Search companies...") to filter the company list. This is helpful when you need to quickly find a specific company's tool status.

## Planner Integration

When tool stack items are synced to companies, MSPortal automatically creates corresponding planner items. This means every tool deployment appears as a trackable task in the Planner.

### How It Works

1. When a tool item is synced to a company, a **planner item** is created with:
   - Title matching the tool name
   - Due date set to the end of the current month
   - Business value set to "Medium"
   - Cost estimate from the tool's default price
   - Source marked as "Tool Stack"

2. The planner item and tool stack tracking record are linked, so:
   - Updating the tool stack status updates the linked planner item
   - The planner item shows the tool stack source

3. You can view and manage these items in the regular Planner views (list, timeline, monthly).

<Tip>
Filter the Planner by source "Tool Stack" to see all tool deployment tasks across your portfolio.
</Tip>

### Deleting Tool Items

When deleting a tool item that has linked planner items:

- A warning shows how many linked planner items will be deleted
- You must type the item name to confirm deletion
- Both the tool tracking records and linked planner items are permanently removed

## Impact on Health Scores

The Tool Stack deployment percentage directly feeds into the **Tool Stack dimension** of Client Health scores:

- Only **required** tools count toward the health dimension
- The score is a linear mapping: 80% deployed = 80 dimension score
- Companies with no required tools show N/A for this dimension

This creates a direct incentive to drive tool standardization across your client base.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with your core stack">
    Begin by adding the 5-10 tools that every company should have (EDR, backup, email security, etc.). Mark these as Required. Add recommended but optional tools later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use categories to organize logically">
    Group tools by function (Security, Backup, Productivity, Monitoring) rather than by vendor. This makes the compliance matrix easier to read.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic default prices">
    The default price is used when creating planner items. Set it to the typical per-company cost so your planner accurately reflects deployment budgets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Link categories to planner types">
    Set the Planner Type on each category so that automatically created planner items are properly categorized and appear in the right views.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review the matrix weekly">
    Use the compliance matrix in your weekly team meetings to track deployment progress. Filter by Not Started to identify gaps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use N/A strategically">
    Mark tools as N/A for companies where they genuinely don't apply (e.g., a backup tool for a company that uses a different backup solution you support). Don't use N/A to hide gaps.
  </Accordion>
