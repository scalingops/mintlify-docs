Client Health provides a comprehensive health scoring system that tells you exactly where to focus your resources. Every company in your portfolio receives a health score from 0 to 100, calculated across 8 dimensions using data from your connected integrations.

## Overview

The Client Health dashboard shows all your companies in a sortable, filterable table with their health scores, risk levels, and individual dimension scores. At a glance, you can identify which companies need attention and which are thriving.

## Dashboard

Navigate to **Client Health** in the main sidebar to open the dashboard.

### Summary Cards

At the top of the dashboard, summary cards provide a portfolio-wide snapshot:

- **Avg Health Score** - The average health score across all companies
- **Avg NPS** - Average Net Promoter Score from surveys
- **Tool Stack** - Average tool stack deployment percentage
- **Companies** - Total number of companies being tracked

Below the averages, colored pills show the distribution of companies across risk levels:
- **Thriving** (green) - Companies performing well across all dimensions
- **Healthy** (blue) - Companies in good standing with minor areas for improvement
- **At Risk** (yellow) - Companies showing concerning trends that need attention
- **Critical** (red) - Companies requiring immediate intervention

### Spotlight Section

The Spotlight section highlights two important groups:

- **Needs Attention** - Companies whose health scores have declined the most recently
- **Most Improved** - Companies whose scores have improved the most

This helps you quickly see who's trending in the wrong direction without scanning the full table.

### Company Table

The main table shows one row per company with the following default columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## The 8 Health Dimensions

Each dimension measures a different aspect of the client relationship. Scores are computed using a percentile-based system that compares each company against your portfolio.

### Service Quality

Measures how effectively you're resolving support issues.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Resolution Time | 40% | Average days to close tickets (lower is better) |
| Hours Per Ticket | 35% | Average labor hours per ticket (lower is better) |
| Escalation Rate | 25% | Percentage of escalated tickets (lower is better) |

### Engagement

Measures the strength and frequency of your client interactions.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Service Engagement | 34% | Days since last contact (fewer is better) |
| Proactive Engagement | 33% | Days since last meeting (fewer is better) |
| NPS Score | 33% | Net Promoter Score from surveys (higher is better) |

### Financial

Measures the financial health and profitability of the relationship.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Profitability | 50% | Financial grade/score from Financial Reporting |
| Late Invoices | 30% | Count of overdue invoices (fewer is better) |
| Days to Pay | 20% | Average invoice payment time (fewer is better) |

### Sales

Measures pipeline activity and revenue growth potential.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Opportunity Recency | 60% | Days since last quote (fewer is better) |
| Win Rate | 40% | Quote win percentage (higher is better) |

### Projects

Measures project engagement and activity.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Project Count (365d) | Number of projects in the last year |
| Project Recency | How recently the last project was active |

### Tool Stack

Measures how completely the company has adopted your recommended tools.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Deployment Percentage | Ratio of deployed required tools to total required tools |

<Tip>
The Tool Stack dimension score is a direct linear mapping of deployment percentage. A company with 80% of required tools deployed scores 80 on this dimension.
</Tip>

### Environment

Measures the technical health of the company's environment.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Device Count | 60% | Total managed devices (more indicates larger engagement) |
| Active User % | 40% | Percentage of users actively using managed services |

### Operational

Measures how well day-to-day operations are running.

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Overdue Tasks | 50% | Count of overdue planner items and compliance assignments (fewer is better) |
| Goal Completion | 50% | Percentage of company goals completed (higher is better) |

## Configuring Health Scoring

Navigate to **Settings > MSP Tools > Scoring** to configure which dimensions are included in health score calculations.

### Enabling/Disabling Dimensions

Each of the 8 dimensions can be toggled on or off:

- **Enabled dimensions** contribute their weighted score to the overall health score
- **Disabled dimensions** are excluded from calculations entirely
- When a dimension is disabled, its weight is redistributed proportionally across the remaining enabled dimensions

<Warning>
Changes to scoring configuration affect all companies immediately. The next refresh cycle (or manual refresh) will recalculate scores with the new configuration.
</Warning>

### When to Disable Dimensions

Consider disabling a dimension when:

- You don't have the data source connected (e.g., disable Sales if you don't track quotes)
- A dimension isn't relevant to your business model
- You want to focus scoring on specific areas

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review critical companies weekly">
    Filter the dashboard by **Critical** risk level and review each company's detail page. Look at the Negative Drivers section to understand what's pulling scores down.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the Spotlight section daily">
    Check the Needs Attention list each morning to catch companies that are declining before they become critical.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track trends over time">
    Individual score snapshots are less useful than trends. Use the 180-day trend chart on detail pages to see whether your interventions are working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connect all available integrations">
    The more data sources you connect, the more accurate health scores become. Missing data results in dimensions being scored as N/A.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calibrate scoring to your business">
    If certain dimensions consistently produce unexpected results, consider disabling them or adjusting your thresholds. The goal is for the score to match your intuition about client health.
