MSP Tools is a suite of analytics and management features purpose-built for MSP operations. It gives you clear visibility into three critical areas of your business: **Client Health**, **Tool Stack**, and **Financial Reporting**.

## How MSP Tools Work Together

The three areas of MSP Tools share data and feed into each other to give you a complete picture of every client relationship:

- **Tool Stack** deployment percentages feed directly into the **Client Health** Tool Stack dimension score
- **Financial Reporting** grades feed into the **Client Health** Financial dimension score
- **Client Health** aggregates data from your PSA, RMM, meetings, compliance, and other integrated systems into a single health score

This means when you improve a company's tool stack coverage or financial health, their overall health score updates automatically.

## Data Sources

MSP Tools pulls data from across your connected integrations:

| Data Source | What It Provides |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **PSA** (ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo, Syncro) | Tickets, invoices, projects, quotes, contacts |
| **RMM** (Datto, etc.) | Device counts, active user percentages |
| **Meetings** | Meeting frequency, days since last contact |
| **Compliance** | Overdue compliance items |
| **Planner** | Overdue planner tasks, goal completion |
| **Tool Stack** | Tool deployment percentages |
| **Surveys** | NPS scores |

<Note>
MSP Tools requires at least one PSA integration to be connected. Additional integrations (RMM, backup, etc.) enrich the data and improve the accuracy of health scores.
</Note>

## Daily Data Refresh

MSP Tools automatically refreshes all metrics **daily at 2:00 AM UTC**. During each refresh cycle:

1. Raw data is pulled from all connected integrations
2. Per-company metrics are computed and stored (40+ metrics per company)
3. Health scores are calculated based on your scoring configuration
4. A daily snapshot is saved for trend tracking (retained for 2 years)

You can also trigger a manual refresh at any time from the Client Health page by clicking **Refresh Scores**.
