The Surveys module helps you collect feedback from clients through Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys and custom questionnaires. Use AI to design surveys, organize recipients into groups, and analyze responses with sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before creating surveys, ensure you have:

- Access to the **Surveys** module in your navigation
- The `manage_surveys` permission to create and send surveys
- At least one company or contact in your database to receive surveys

Surveys are created using a 3-step wizard that guides you through design, recipient selection, and scheduling.

## Managing Surveys

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep Surveys Short" icon="clock">
    Aim for 5-10 questions maximum. Shorter surveys have higher completion rates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Clear Language" icon="message">
    Write questions that are easy to understand. Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Before Sending" icon="flask">
    Preview your survey and send a test to yourself first.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Follow Up Promptly" icon="bell">
    Enable reminders to catch non-respondents within 3-5 days.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### NPS Best Practices

- **Score Threshold for Reviews**: Only show review links to promoters (9-10 scores) to avoid negative public reviews
- **Consistent Timing**: Send NPS surveys at regular intervals to track trends
- **Act on Feedback**: Use the AI analysis to identify actionable themes
