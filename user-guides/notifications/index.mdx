## Understanding Notification Types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Info | Blue circle | General information about system events |
| Success | Green checkmark | Confirmation of successful operations |
| Warning | Yellow triangle | Issues requiring attention but not critical |
| Error | Red circle | Critical issues requiring immediate action |

## Understanding Approval Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Awaiting review and decision |
| Approved | Action was approved and executed |
| Rejected | Action was rejected and not executed |
| Expired | Approval window has passed |

## Notification Sources

Notifications can originate from various sources:

- **System**: Core platform events and updates
- **Automation Rules**: Triggered by configured automation rules
- **Integrations**: Events from connected services

## Best Practices

- **Regular Check**: Review notifications regularly to stay on top of important events
- **Clear Read Items**: Mark notifications as read once reviewed to keep the unread count meaningful
- **Timely Approvals**: Process pending approvals promptly to avoid delays in automated workflows
- **Filter Effectively**: Use filters to focus on high-priority notification types

<Warning>
Pending approvals may have time limits. Review and act on them before they expire to ensure automated workflows complete as expected.
