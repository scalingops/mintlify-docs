## Summary Configuration

### Email Details

Configure the basic email settings:

- **To** - Select recipients from meeting attendees or add custom addresses
- **Subject** - Auto-populated with meeting name, editable as needed
- **From** - Your email address (configurable in settings)

### Email Method

Choose how to send the summary:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MSPortal** | Send directly through MSPortal's email system |
| **PSA Integration** | Route through your PSA's email system for tracking |

### AI Configuration

Customize how the AI generates your summary:

- **Tone** - Professional, friendly, or technical
- **Length** - Brief overview or detailed recap
- **Focus Areas** - Emphasize action items, decisions, or discussion points

## Generating the Summary

Click **Generate with AI** to create the meeting summary. The AI analyzes:

- Meeting agenda items and their content
- Meeting notes you've captured
- Attendee information
- Meeting type and context

The generated summary includes:

- **Professional greeting** addressed to the attendee
- **Meeting overview** summarizing what was discussed
- **Key discussion points** with specific details from your agenda
- **Action items and next steps** for follow-up
- **Closing** with contact information

### Email Content Editor

The summary appears in a rich text editor where you can:

- Edit any part of the generated text
- Add additional information
- Remove sections that aren't relevant
- Format text with bold, italic, lists, etc.
- Insert links or images

<Tip>
Always review the AI-generated content before sending. While the AI does an excellent job summarizing, you may want to add personal touches or correct any specific details.

## PSA Integration

### Link to Autotask Ticket

If you use Autotask as your PSA, you can save the meeting summary directly to a ticket:

1. Check **Add as note to Autotask ticket**
2. Select or search for the relevant ticket
3. When you send the summary, it's automatically added as a note to that ticket

This creates a permanent record of client communications in your PSA system, making it easy to track the history of client interactions.

<Note>
PSA integration options vary based on your connected integrations. Similar functionality is available for ConnectWise and other supported PSAs.
</Note>

## Sending the Summary

Once you're satisfied with the summary:

1. Review all recipients in the **To** field
2. Verify the subject line is appropriate
3. Make any final edits to the content
4. Click **Send** to deliver the summary

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Capture notes during the meeting">
    The AI uses your meeting notes to generate more accurate and detailed summaries. Take notes throughout the meeting for the best results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build comprehensive agendas">
    The more agenda items you include, the more context the AI has to work with. Planner items, budgets, and compliance checks all contribute to richer summaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review before sending">
    Always read through the generated summary. Check for accuracy, appropriate tone, and completeness before sending to clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use PSA integration">
    Link summaries to PSA tickets to maintain a complete record of client communications. This helps with continuity when team members change or when reviewing account history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Send promptly">
    Send summaries within 24 hours of the meeting while the discussion is still fresh. Prompt follow-up demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail.
