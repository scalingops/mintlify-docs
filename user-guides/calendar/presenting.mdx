MSPortal's presentation mode transforms your meeting agenda into a professional slide deck, perfect for QBRs and client-facing meetings.

## Starting a Presentation

From any meeting page, click the **Present** button in the header to launch presentation mode.

## Presentation Overview

When you enter presentation mode, you'll first see an overview of all agenda items:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/calendar/present-overview.png" alt="Presentation Overview" />
</Frame>

The overview displays:

- **All agenda items** organized by type
- **Quick navigation** - click any item to jump directly to it
- **Item counts** showing how many items of each type are included

This overview helps you see the full meeting structure at a glance and navigate to specific sections as needed.

## Presenting Individual Items

Click **Next** or select an item from the overview to view it in detail:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/calendar/present-slide.png" alt="Individual Slide View" />
</Frame>

Each item is displayed as a full-screen slide with all relevant details. For example, a Planner Item shows:

- **Title** - The task or project name
- **Start Date** and **Due Date** - Timeline information
- **Estimated Hours** - Time investment required
- **Cost Estimate** - Budget implications
- **Business Value** - Why this work matters
- **Description** - Full details about the item
- **Public Notes** - Additional context for the client

## Navigation Controls

The presentation interface includes intuitive navigation:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Next** | Move to the next slide |
| **Previous** | Go back to the previous slide |
| **Overview** | Return to the full agenda overview |
| **Exit** | Leave presentation mode and return to the meeting page |

<Tip>
Use keyboard shortcuts for smoother presentations: Arrow keys navigate between slides, and Escape exits presentation mode.
