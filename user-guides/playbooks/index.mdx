## What Happens When You Apply

When you apply a playbook to a company:

2. Checks are assigned to your selected status tracking list
3. Each check starts with an initial status ready for assessment
4. You can then track, update, and report on compliance status

<Note>
Playbooks create copies of checks. Changes to a playbook after application do not affect previously applied checks.
