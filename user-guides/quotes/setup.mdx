This guide walks you through connecting your Quoter (by ScalePad) account to MSPortal.ai. Once connected, your quotes will sync automatically every 4 hours, giving your team a centralized view of all proposals alongside company data, meetings, and other modules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Quoter](https://www.quoter.com) account
- API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from your Quoter account
- Your Quoter subdomain (the part before `.quoter.com` in your account URL)
- Admin access to MSPortal.ai with the **manage_settings_integrations** permission

<Info>
  To obtain your Quoter API credentials, log in to your Quoter account and navigate to your account settings or contact Quoter support for API access.
</Info>

## Setup Wizard

MSPortal.ai provides a guided wizard to connect and configure your Quoter integration.

### Starting the Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In MSPortal.ai, go to **Settings > Integrations**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the Quoter Card">
    Locate the **Quoter** integration card in the integrations grid. Click **Configure** to launch the setup wizard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 1: Connect

Enter your Quoter API credentials to establish the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    Fill in the following fields:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Client ID** | Your Quoter API Client ID |
    | **Client Secret** | Your Quoter API Client Secret |

    <Warning>
      Keep your API credentials secure. They are stored encrypted in MSPortal.ai's vault and are never exposed after initial entry.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. MSPortal.ai will authenticate with the Quoter API using OAuth and confirm the connection.

    If the connection fails:
    - Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are copied correctly
    - Confirm your Quoter account has API access enabled
    - Check that your Quoter subscription includes API access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Once connected, click **Next** to continue to company mapping.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Map Companies

Map your Quoter clients to MSPortal companies so quotes are associated with the correct company records.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Quoter Clients">
    MSPortal.ai displays a list of all clients from your Quoter account. Each client needs to be mapped to an existing MSPortal company.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Quick Match">
    Click **Quick Match** to let MSPortal.ai automatically suggest mappings based on company name similarity. The system uses intelligent matching to find the best fit for each Quoter client.

    - Matches are ranked by confidence score
    - Review suggested mappings before confirming
    - You can adjust or override any suggestion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual Mapping">
    For clients that weren't matched automatically, use the dropdown next to each client to manually select the corresponding MSPortal company.

    <Tip>
      If a Quoter client doesn't have a corresponding MSPortal company yet, you can create the company first in **Settings > Companies** and then return to complete the mapping.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Mappings">
    Click **Save** to confirm your company mappings. You can update these at any time by returning to the integration settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Quoter Subdomain">
    Enter your **Quoter subdomain** - this is the part before `.quoter.com` in your Quoter URL.

    For example, if you access Quoter at `https://yourcompany.quoter.com`, enter `yourcompany`.

    | Field | Description | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Subdomain** | Your Quoter subdomain | `yourcompany` |

    <Note>
      The subdomain is used to generate direct links from MSPortal.ai to your quotes in Quoter. Without it, the "Open in Quoter" action won't be available.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click **Complete** to finish the wizard. MSPortal.ai will trigger an initial sync of your quotes in the background.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## After Setup

Once the integration is active:

- **Automatic sync** runs every 4 hours, pulling new and updated quotes from Quoter
- **Quotes** appear in the **Quotes** module in the main sidebar
- **Company mapping** ensures quotes are linked to the correct MSPortal companies
- **PSA linking** automatically associates quotes with companies when matching PSA opportunity IDs are found (ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo, HubSpot, Kaseya, Pipedrive, Salesforce)

---

## Managing the Integration

After setup, you can manage your Quoter integration from **Settings > Integrations**:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configure** | Re-open the setup wizard to modify credentials, mappings, or subdomain |
| **Sync Quotes** | Trigger a manual sync of quotes from Quoter |
| **Update Mappings** | Re-map Quoter clients to MSPortal companies |
| **Remove Integration** | Disconnect Quoter and remove synced data |

<Warning>
  Removing the integration will delete all synced quote data from MSPortal.ai. This action cannot be undone. Your quotes in Quoter are not affected.
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct and that your Quoter account has API access |
| Quotes not appearing | Check that the initial sync has completed; trigger a manual sync from integration settings |
| Quotes not linked to companies | Verify company mappings in the integration wizard or run Quick Match again |
| "Open in Quoter" not working | Ensure the Quoter subdomain is configured in the integration settings |
| Stale quote data | Trigger a manual sync; automatic sync runs every 4 hours |
| Missing line items | Line items sync alongside quotes; trigger a manual sync if they're missing |
