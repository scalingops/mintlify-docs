The Quotes module brings your [Quoter](https://www.quoter.com) quotes into MSPortal.ai, giving you a centralized view of all proposals alongside your other client data. Quotes sync automatically from Quoter every 4 hours, so your team always has up-to-date pricing and proposal information without switching between tools.

<Note>
  Quotes in MSPortal.ai are **read-only**. All quote creation and editing is done in Quoter. MSPortal.ai syncs and displays your quotes so you can reference them alongside company data, meetings, and other modules.

## Quote Actions

### Open in Quoter

From the quotes list, click the **actions menu** (three dots) on any row and select **Open in Quoter** to jump directly to that quote in your Quoter account. This requires a Quoter subdomain to be configured during integration setup.

### Add to Meeting

Select **Add to Meeting** from the actions menu to attach a quote to an upcoming meeting agenda. This is useful for discussing proposals during quarterly business reviews or client check-ins.

## How Sync Works

- Quotes sync automatically from Quoter **every 4 hours**
- The sync pulls all quotes and their line items from the Quoter API
- Quotes are automatically mapped to MSPortal companies when a matching PSA opportunity is found
- Company mapping can also be configured manually during integration setup
- You can trigger a manual sync from **Settings > Integrations** on the Quoter integration card

<Info>
  If you just created a quote in Quoter and don't see it yet, you can trigger a manual sync from the integration settings rather than waiting for the next automatic sync.
