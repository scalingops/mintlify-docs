Templates are reusable blueprints that define your onboarding process. Each template contains phases (workflow stages) and tasks (individual action items) that get copied into a portal when you launch onboarding for a client.

## Creating a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Templates">
    Go to **Settings > Onboarding > Templates** and click **New Template**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Template Details">
    Enter a **name**, optional **description**, and **tags** for organization. Set the **estimated duration** to help plan timelines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Phases">
    Click **Add Phase** to create workflow stages. Each phase represents a logical grouping of tasks (e.g., "Discovery", "Setup", "Training", "Go Live"). Drag phases to reorder them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tasks to Phases">
    Click **Add Item** within a phase to create tasks. Configure each task's type, ownership, and evidence requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to save your template. It's now available when launching portals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Phases

Phases are the major stages of your onboarding workflow. They execute sequentially and provide visual progress tracking for both your team and the client.

Each phase has:

- **Name** — A descriptive label (e.g., "Network Discovery", "Migration", "Training")
- **Description** — Optional details about the phase's purpose
- **Order** — Drag to reorder phases within the template
- **Estimated Duration** — Expected time to complete

<Tip>
Keep phases high-level (3–6 per template works well). Use tasks within phases for the detailed steps.
</Tip>

## Task Types

Each task can collect a specific type of evidence or require a particular action. Set the **evidence type** when creating a task.

### Standard Task

A basic task with optional text evidence. The assignee marks it complete, optionally providing notes.

**Use for:** General action items, internal setup steps, verification tasks

### Meeting

Schedule a meeting directly from the task. Generates calendar invitations with ICS attachments and sends email invitations to selected attendees.

**Use for:** Kickoff calls, discovery sessions, training walkthroughs

### Document Upload

Request specific documents from the client. Documents go through an upload → review → approve/reject workflow.

**Use for:** Insurance certificates, network diagrams, vendor contracts, existing IT documentation

### Digital Signature

Collect a digital signature from the client using a built-in signature pad. Optionally attach a PDF document for the client to review before signing.

**Use for:** Service agreements, acceptable use policies, authorization forms

### Credential Handoff

Securely collect credentials from the client. Supports two modes:

- **Single mode** — Username, password, API key, and notes fields
- **Bulk mode** — Text paste or file upload for multiple credentials at once

Submitted credentials are encrypted and auto-hide after 5 minutes when revealed by MSP staff.

**Use for:** Admin passwords, VPN credentials, vendor logins, API keys

### Secure File Drop

Allows clients to upload files that expire after download. Includes time-based expiration tracking and secure download links.

**Use for:** Sensitive configuration files, license keys, security certificates

### Training

Embed training content directly in the task. Supports two modes:

- **Video mode** — Embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom with auto-parsed embed URLs
- **In-person mode** — Instructions for scheduled training sessions

**Use for:** Security awareness training, platform walkthroughs, tool-specific training

### Survey / Form

Link a survey or form from your Surveys module. Clients complete the survey inline within the portal.

**Use for:** IT environment questionnaires, user inventories, preference surveys, needs assessments

### Approval

Request a formal approve/reject decision from the client. Optionally attach a supporting document for context.

**Use for:** Budget approvals, scope sign-offs, design approvals, change requests

### Checklist

Attach a checklist template with granular sub-items. Both MSP staff and clients can check off individual items.

**Use for:** Server setup verification, workstation deployment steps, migration readiness checks

## Task Configuration

Beyond the evidence type, each task has several configuration options:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | The task name displayed to both MSP and client |
| **Description** | Detailed instructions or context |
| **Owner** | Who is responsible: **MSP** (your team) or **Client** |
| **Priority** | Low, Normal, High, or Critical |
| **Due Date Logic** | Offset from phase start, portal start, or dependency completion |
| **Dependencies** | Block this task until another task is completed |
| **Category** | Optional tag for organizing tasks |
| **Milestone** | Flag important tasks as milestones |

### Task Dependencies

Tasks can depend on other tasks. A dependent task appears as "blocked" until its prerequisite is completed. This ensures tasks execute in the correct order.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dependency Picker">
    When editing a task, click **Add Dependency**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Prerequisites">
    Choose one or more tasks from any phase that must complete before this task unblocks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    The task will show as blocked in the portal until all dependencies are met.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Task Ownership

Each task is owned by either the **MSP** or the **Client**:

- **MSP tasks** appear under "Our Progress" in the client portal and are managed by your team
- **Client tasks** appear under "Your Tasks" in the client portal and require client action

## Documents, Surveys, and Approvals

In addition to tasks, phases can contain:

- **Documents** — Specific files to request from clients (with allowed file type restrictions)
- **Surveys** — Linked survey templates from the Surveys module
- **Approvals** — Formal approve/reject items with optional supporting documents

These appear in dedicated sections of the client portal alongside tasks.

## AI Template Designer

Generate complete onboarding templates using AI. Describe your onboarding process in plain language and AI creates the phases, tasks, and structure for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the AI Sidebar">
    In the template builder, click the **AI** button to open the AI design sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Process">
    Type a description like "Create an onboarding template for a 50-person law firm migrating from on-prem Exchange to Microsoft 365" or "Add a security hardening phase with MFA enrollment and endpoint protection tasks."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Diff">
    AI generates proposed changes shown in a diff preview. Review each change — added phases, tasks, and configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply or Adjust">
    Click **Apply** to accept the changes, or continue the conversation to refine. You can undo the last AI application if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The AI designer works best when you provide context about the client type, size, and specific requirements. You can also ask it to modify an existing template — for example, "Add a compliance documentation phase after the migration phase."
</Tip>

## Import & Export

Share templates across tenants or back them up using JSON import/export.

- **Export** — Click the **⋯** menu on a template and select **Export**. Downloads a JSON file containing the complete template structure.
- **Import** — On the templates list page, click **Import** and upload a JSON template file. Review the imported structure before saving.

## Checklist Templates

Checklist templates are reusable sets of sub-items that can be attached to any task.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Checklists">
    Go to **Settings > Onboarding > Checklists**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Checklist">
    Click **New Checklist**, give it a name and description, then add individual items with labels and ordering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to Tasks">
    When configuring a task in the template builder, select a checklist template. The checklist items will appear as checkable sub-items within the task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Template Management

### Archiving Templates

Archive templates you no longer need. Archived templates are hidden from the template list but can be restored at any time. Existing portals using archived templates are not affected.

### Duplicating Templates

Duplicate a template to create a variant. Click the **⋯** menu on any template and select **Duplicate** to create an identical copy you can modify independently.

### Change History

The template builder tracks changes over time. View the change history to see when modifications were made and by whom.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep templates focused">
    Create separate templates for different client types (e.g., "SMB Onboarding", "Enterprise Migration", "M365 Setup Only") rather than one massive template with optional phases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use dependencies strategically">
    Only add dependencies where order truly matters. Over-blocking tasks creates unnecessary bottlenecks for clients.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balance MSP and client tasks">
    Don't put all the work on the client. Include MSP-owned tasks so clients can see your team's progress too — it builds trust and transparency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add clear descriptions">
    Write task descriptions from the client's perspective. Instead of "Provide AD credentials," write "Please provide your Active Directory administrator username and password so we can begin the migration."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the AI designer for first drafts">
    Start with AI to generate a baseline template, then customize it to match your exact process. This is much faster than building from scratch.
