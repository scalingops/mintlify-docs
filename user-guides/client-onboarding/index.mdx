The Client Onboarding module provides a complete system for onboarding new clients to your MSP. Build reusable templates, launch branded portals for each company, and track every step of the process — from initial discovery through full deployment.

## Overview

Client onboarding in MSPortal works in three layers:

1. **Templates** — Reusable blueprints that define your onboarding process (phases, tasks, documents, surveys, approvals)
2. **Portals** — Active instances of templates launched for a specific company, with their own contacts, progress, and timeline
3. **Client Portal** — A branded, secure experience where clients complete tasks, upload documents, sign agreements, and track progress
