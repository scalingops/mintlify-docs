Follow these six steps to build a template, launch a portal, and send your first client their invite.

---

## 1. Build a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings > Onboarding > Templates">
    Click **New Template**. Enter a name and estimated duration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the AI Designer">
    Click the **AI** button on the right side of the screen. Describe your onboarding process in plain language — e.g., *"Onboard a 20-person company migrating to M365 with discovery, setup, migration, training, and go-live phases."*

    Review the suggested changes, then click **Apply**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit as needed">
    Adjust phase names, task descriptions, ownership (MSP vs Client), priorities, and dependencies. Click **Save Changes**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The AI gets you 80% there. Spend a few minutes tweaking task descriptions and ownership to match your process.
</Tip>

## 2. Create Checklists

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to the Checklists tab">
    Still in **Settings > Onboarding**, click the **Checklists** tab, then **New Checklist**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add items quickly">
    Use **AI Generate** to describe what you need, or **Import** a bulleted list. Save the checklist, then go back to your template and link it to any relevant tasks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 3. Launch a Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the company">
    Navigate to the company you want to onboard and click the **Onboarding** tab. Click **Start Onboarding**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your template and add contacts">
    Choose your template from the dropdown. Add each client contact with their **name**, **email**, and **role** (Primary Contact, IT Contact, Decision Maker, etc.).

    Click **Create Portal**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The portal is created in **Draft** mode — not live yet.

---

## 4. Configure Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Tasks tab">
    Review each phase and task. Make sure descriptions are clear, evidence types are correct, and dependencies make sense for this client.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign every MSP task">
    Click the assignee area on each task and select a team member. Use **Reassign** in the toolbar for bulk assignment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Unassigned tasks won't appear in anyone's dashboard. Assign everything before going live.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Review

Switch to the **Overview** tab and verify:

- All contacts have correct email addresses
- All phases are present and in order
- No MSP tasks are unassigned

---

## 6. Go Live

<Steps>
  <Step title="Activate the portal">
    Click **Start Portal** on the Overview tab, then confirm with **Start & Send Invites**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clients get emailed">
    Each contact receives a secure invite link. They verify their email, then land on their personalized portal with tasks, documents, and progress tracking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your portal is live. Clients can start completing tasks immediately.
