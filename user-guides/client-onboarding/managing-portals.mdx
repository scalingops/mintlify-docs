Portals are active onboarding instances launched for a specific company. When you create a portal from a template, it copies the template's phases and tasks into a live workspace where you track progress, communicate with clients, and manage the onboarding process.

## Launching a Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Company Page">
    Navigate to the company you want to onboard and click the **Onboarding** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Onboarding">
    Click **Start Onboarding**. Select a template from the dropdown — this determines the phases, tasks, and structure of the portal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Client Contacts">
    Add the client contacts who will access the portal. Enter their name, email, and role. Mark one contact as **Primary**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate the Portal">
    Click **Start Portal** to activate it. This generates secure access links for each contact and optionally sends invite emails.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can also create a portal in **Draft** mode first, make adjustments to tasks and phases, and activate it later when ready.
</Note>

## Portal Lifecycle

Portals move through these stages:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Being configured, not yet visible to clients |
| **Active** | Live — clients can access and complete tasks |
| **Completed** | All phases and tasks finished |
| **Converted** | Migrated to your permanent systems (optional final step) |
| **Archived** | Historical record, no longer active |

## The Onboarding Tab

The company onboarding page has four tabs for managing the portal:

### Overview Tab

The main dashboard showing:

- **Portal status** with progress percentage
- **Phase-by-phase progress bars** showing completion
- **Task summary** with counts by status
- **Quick actions** for managing the portal lifecycle

### Tasks Tab

The primary workspace for managing onboarding tasks.

#### Status Legend

At the top, a legend shows the four task statuses with their icons:

- **Pending** (circle) — Not yet started
- **In Progress** (clock) — Work underway
- **Completed** (checkmark) — Done
- **Blocked** (lock) — Waiting on a dependency

<Tip>
Click a task's status icon to cycle it forward (pending → in progress → completed). Right-click to choose any status from a dropdown menu.
</Tip>

#### Phase Accordions

Tasks are grouped by phase in expandable accordions. Each phase header shows:

- Phase name and status badge
- Task completion count (e.g., "3 of 7 completed")
- Progress bar

Click a phase to expand it and see all tasks within.

#### Task Rows

Each task row displays:

- **Status icon** — Click to update, right-click for all options
- **Task title** — With evidence type badge (signature, credentials, meeting, etc.)
- **Owner badge** — MSP or Client
- **Due date** — Red if overdue, amber if due within 3 days
- **Assigned user** — Who is responsible
- **Priority indicator** — For high and critical tasks

Click a task row to expand its detail panel, which shows:

- Evidence content (signatures, credentials, uploaded files, survey responses)
- Task description
- Comment thread for discussion
- Checklist items (if attached)

#### Task Assignment

Assign tasks to MSP team members individually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Assignee Area">
    Click the assignee name or "Unassigned" on any task row.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a User">
    Search and select a team member from the dropdown.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For bulk reassignment, click **Reassign** in the toolbar to enter selection mode. Use checkboxes (with shift-click for range selection) to select multiple tasks, then assign them all at once.

#### Sending Task Emails

Send task summary emails to client contacts:

- **Send All Tasks** — Emails a complete summary of all tasks with status and due dates
- **Send Phase Tasks** — Emails tasks for a specific phase only
- **Send Task Reminder** — Send a reminder for an individual task

Each email includes task descriptions, status badges, due dates, and a link back to the portal.

### Documents Tab

The document triage inbox where you review files uploaded by clients.

- **Filter by status** — View all, pending review, approved, or rejected documents
- **Search** — Find documents by name or phase
- **Review actions** — Click a document to approve or reject it with optional notes
- **Download** — Download the original uploaded file

### Activity Tab

A complete audit trail of every portal event, with server-side search and type filtering.

Events tracked include:

- Portal and phase status changes
- Task completions and assignments
- Document uploads, approvals, and rejections
- Contact access and invitations
- Signatures and credential submissions
- Meeting scheduling
- Comments and questions

Use the **search bar** to find events by description, actor name, or email. Use the **type filter** dropdown to show only specific event categories (Portal, Phase, Task, Document, Contact, etc.).

## Contact Management

Manage who has access to the client portal.

### Adding Contacts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Contact List">
    In the portal overview, find the contacts section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Contact">
    Click **Add Contact** and enter the contact's name, email, and role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invite">
    Click **Send Invite** to email the contact their secure access link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Contact Roles

Assign roles to help identify each contact's responsibility:

- Primary Contact
- IT Contact
- Decision Maker
- Finance Contact
- Office Manager

### Managing Access

- **Resend Invite** — Send the access link again if the contact lost it
- **Revoke Access** — Immediately disable a contact's portal access
- **Regenerate Token** — Create a new access link (invalidates the old one)

Contact activity is tracked — you can see when each contact last accessed the portal and how many times.

## Meeting Scheduling

Schedule meetings directly from meeting-type tasks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Schedule Meeting">
    On a meeting task, click **Schedule Meeting**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Meeting Details">
    Enter the date, time, duration, and optional description. Add a meeting link if using a specific platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Attendees">
    Choose from portal contacts and optionally add external attendees by email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitations">
    Click **Schedule** to send calendar invitations (ICS) via email to all attendees.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Credential & Signature Review

### Reviewing Credentials

When a client submits credentials through a credential handoff task:

1. Open the task detail panel
2. Click **Reveal Credentials** to view the submitted values
3. Credentials auto-hide after 5 minutes for security
4. For bulk submissions, download the uploaded file

### Reviewing Signatures

When a client signs a signature task:

1. Open the task detail panel to view the signature image
2. See signer details: name, email, IP address, and timestamp
3. If a document was attached, the signed document is also available

## Completing a Portal

When all tasks and phases are complete:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Completion">
    Verify all tasks show as completed and all documents are approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the Portal">
    Click **Complete Portal** in the overview actions. This marks the portal as finished.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert (Optional)">
    If this client is now fully set up in your systems, click **Convert** to mark the portal as converted — a final status indicating the client has been migrated to your permanent tooling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dashboard Integration

Your MSP dashboard shows onboarding information in two places:

- **Active Onboarding Banner** — Quick-link pills showing each active portal with company name, portal name, and a progress bar. Click to jump directly to the portal.
- **My Onboarding Tasks Widget** — A card showing your personally assigned onboarding tasks across all active portals, ordered by phase and task order. Click any task to go to its portal.

Both are visible only when you have onboarding permissions and there are active portals.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with a draft">
    Create portals in draft mode first. Review the tasks, adjust descriptions for the specific client, and add contacts before activating. This avoids sending premature invitations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign tasks early">
    Assign MSP tasks to specific team members as soon as the portal goes active. This ensures tasks appear in everyone's dashboard widget.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the activity feed">
    Check the activity feed regularly to stay informed about client progress. You can see exactly when contacts access the portal and complete tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Send task summaries proactively">
    Don't wait for clients to log in. Use the email features to send task summaries and reminders, especially for overdue items.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review documents promptly">
    Clients see document status in their portal. Leaving documents in "pending review" for too long creates a poor experience — aim to review within 24 hours.
  </Accordion>
