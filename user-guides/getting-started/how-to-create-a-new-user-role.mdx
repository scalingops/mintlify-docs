User roles are essential for controlling access to different features and modules within MSPortal. This guide walks you through creating custom roles for your team members.

## Prerequisites
- You must be logged in as a Primary Admin or have the "Manage Roles" permission
- Plan which permissions each role needs before creating it

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to Settings

Go to [https://msportal.ai/company_overview](https://msportal.ai/company_overview) and click on **Settings** in the main navigation.

### 2. Access Users and Roles

Click on **Users and Roles** from the Settings menu.

> **Important:** You must create roles before importing users, as each user must be assigned to a role.

### 3. Configure Role Permissions

On the Create Role form, configure the following:

#### Role Details
- **Role Name:** Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Help Desk Technician", "Account Manager")
- **Description:** Add a brief description of the role's purpose
- **Set as Default:** Check this box if you want this role to appear first in dropdown menus

#### Permission Levels

Permissions are organized by module with three access levels:

- **Read:** View-only access to module content
- **Write:** Can create and edit items (tickets, tasks, etc.)
- **Manage:** Full module administration including settings

#### Module Permissions

Select appropriate permissions for each module:
- Company Overview
- Ticketing
- Training
- Compliance
- Reporting
- Calendar
- Planner
- Devices
- Budgets
- Goals
- Surveys

#### Administrative Settings

The Settings section at the bottom controls system-wide permissions:

> **Warning:** Be cautious when granting Settings permissions, especially:
> - Import/Export permissions (access to sensitive data)
> - User Management (can create/modify other users)
> - Integration Settings (can modify external connections)

#### Recommended First Roles

1. **Administrator:** Full access to all modules and settings
2. **Manager:** Read/Write access to most modules, limited settings
3. **Technician:** Read/Write for tickets and devices, read-only elsewhere
4. **End User:** Read-only access to relevant modules


### 4. Save the Role

Once you've configured all permissions, click the **Create Role** button at the bottom of the form.

## Next Steps

- Review and adjust permissions as needed based on user feedback
- Create additional roles for different team functions

## Tips

- Start with restrictive permissions and add more as needed
- Document each role's purpose for future reference
- Regularly audit role permissions to maintain security
- Consider creating template roles that can be duplicated and modified
