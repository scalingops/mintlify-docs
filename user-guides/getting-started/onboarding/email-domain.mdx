The Email Domain step configures MSPortal to send emails from your own domain instead of the default MSPortal domain. This improves email deliverability and presents a professional appearance to your clients.

## Why Verify Your Domain?

- **Better Deliverability** - Emails are less likely to be marked as spam
- **Professional Appearance** - Emails come from your domain (e.g., `notifications@yourmsp.com`)
- **Brand Consistency** - Reinforces your brand with every notification

## What You'll Configure

- **Email Domain** - The domain to send emails from
- **DNS Records** - SPF, DKIM, and verification records
- **Sender Address** - The "from" address for notifications

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Email Settings">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Email**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your Domain">
    Enter the domain you want to send emails from (e.g., `yourmsp.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add DNS Records">
    MSPortal will provide DNS records that need to be added to your domain. These typically include:
    - **SPF Record** - Authorizes MSPortal to send email on your behalf
    - **DKIM Record** - Provides email authentication
    - **Verification Record** - Proves domain ownership
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain">
    After adding the DNS records, click **Verify Domain**. DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, but usually completes within a few hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Sender Address">
    Once verified, set up your preferred sender address (e.g., `support@yourmsp.com`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## DNS Record Examples

Here's what the DNS records typically look like:

```
# SPF Record (TXT)
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.msportal.ai ~all

# DKIM Record (TXT)
Type: TXT
Name: msportal._domainkey
Value: [provided by MSPortal]

# Verification Record (TXT)
Type: TXT
Name: _msportal-verify
Value: [provided by MSPortal]
```

## Auto-Completion

This step is **automatically marked as complete** when:
- At least one email domain is verified

<Note>
  If you don't have access to your DNS settings, you may need to involve your domain administrator or skip this step temporarily.
