The Branding step lets you customize MSPortal with your company's visual identity. Your logo and branding appear throughout the portal and in client-facing reports.

## What You'll Configure

- **Primary Logo** - Your main company logo (used in the sidebar and reports)
- **Small Logo** - A compact version for smaller spaces
- **Light/Dark Variants** - Logo versions optimized for different backgrounds
- **Favicon** - The icon that appears in browser tabs
- **Reporting Logo** - A specific logo for generated reports

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Branding Settings">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Tenant** and click the **Branding** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Primary Logo">
    Click the upload area and select your company logo. For best results, use a PNG or SVG file with a transparent background.
