The Ticket Settings step lets you configure how tickets are displayed and synced from your PSA. You'll set up status mappings, display preferences, and sync behavior.

<Note>
  This step only appears if you selected a PSA integration. It becomes available after the initial PSA sync completes.

## What You'll Configure

- **Status Mappings** - Map your PSA statuses to MSPortal status categories

  <Step title="Set Up Status Mappings">
    On the **Statuses** tab, map your PSA ticket statuses to MSPortal categories (Open, In Progress, Waiting, Closed).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Company Settings">
    On the **Companies** tab, set which ticket types are visible to company users.

## Status Categories

MSPortal uses four status categories to organize tickets:

| Category | Description | Example Statuses |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Open** | New tickets awaiting action | New, Unassigned |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | In Progress, Scheduled |
| **Waiting** | On hold or waiting for input | Waiting on Customer, On Hold |
| **Closed** | Completed tickets | Resolved, Closed, Cancelled |

## Manual Completion

This step requires **manual completion**. Click **Mark Complete** in the wizard when you've finished configuring your ticket settings.

<Tip>
  Accurate status mapping is important for reporting. Make sure each PSA status maps to the correct MSPortal category.
