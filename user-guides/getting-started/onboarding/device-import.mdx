The Device Import step lets you review devices synced from your RMM and import them into MSPortal. You can map devices to companies and configure how they're organized.

<Note>
  This step only appears if you selected an RMM integration. It becomes available after the initial RMM sync completes.
</Note>

## What You'll Do

- **Review Synced Devices** - See all devices pulled from your RMM
- **Map to Companies** - Associate devices with the correct client companies
- **Import Devices** - Bring devices into MSPortal's device inventory
- **Configure Device Types** - Set up device categorization

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for RMM Sync">
    If the initial sync is still in progress, the wizard will show a waiting indicator. This ensures your devices are available for review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Device Import">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard. You'll be taken to the device staging area for your RMM integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Staged Devices">
    Browse the list of devices synced from your RMM. Check that device details look correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Devices to Companies">
    For devices that aren't automatically matched, select the correct company from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Devices">
    Select the devices you want to import and click **Import Selected** or **Import All**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Company Matching

MSPortal attempts to automatically match devices to companies based on:
- Site/location names in your RMM
- Company names in your PSA (if connected)
- Previous manual mappings

Devices that can't be automatically matched will need manual assignment.

## Device Types

During import, devices are categorized by type:
- **Workstation** - Desktop computers and laptops
- **Server** - Physical and virtual servers
- **Network** - Routers, switches, firewalls
- **Other** - Printers, UPS, and other devices

## Manual Completion

This step requires **manual completion**. Click **Mark Complete** in the wizard when you've finished importing your devices.

<Tip>
  You don't need to import all devices at once. You can import in batches and return to import more later.
