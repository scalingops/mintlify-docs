The Company Users step helps you import and manage users for your client companies. These are the end users at your client organizations who will access the MSPortal client portal.

## What You'll Configure

- **User Import** - Bring users in from M365 or your PSA
- **User Assignments** - Assign users to companies and roles
- **Portal Access** - Enable or disable portal login for users
- **User Details** - Configure user information and preferences

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Company Users">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Companies > Users**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Existing Users">
    If you've connected M365 or a PSA, some users may already be imported. Review the list to see what's been synced.

  <Step title="Import Additional Users">
    Click **Import Users** to bring in users from:
    - Microsoft 365 (Azure AD/Entra ID)
    - Your PSA system
    - Manual entry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Roles">
    For each user, assign an appropriate company role (Admin, Manager, User, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Portal Access">
    For users who need to log in to the portal, enable their portal access and send invitations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    1. Select the company
    2. Click **Import from M365**
    3. Choose which users to import
    4. Assign roles and enable access as needed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From PSA">
    If you have a PSA connected, you can import contacts as users:
    1. Click **Import from PSA**
    2. Select contacts to import
    3. Map them to the correct company
    4. Assign roles
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Entry">
    Add users individually:
    1. Click **Add User**
    2. Enter name, email, and other details
    3. Select the company and role
    4. Send an invitation email
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## User Roles

Company users are assigned roles that determine their permissions:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to company data, can manage other users |
| **Manager** | Access to most features, limited user management |
| **User** | Standard access for submitting tickets and viewing info |
| **Training Only** | Limited to training courses |

## Portal Access

Users with portal access enabled can:
- Log in to the MSPortal client portal
- Submit and view support tickets
- Complete training courses
- View company dashboards (based on permissions)

## Manual Completion

This step requires **manual completion**. Click **Mark Complete** in the wizard when you've finished setting up users for your client companies.

<Tip>
  Start with key contacts at each company—the people who will submit tickets or need training. You can always add more users later.
