The Tenant Roles step lets you define roles for your internal team members (MSP staff). Each role determines what features and data a team member can access within MSPortal.

## What You'll Configure

- **Role Names** - Define roles like Admin, Technician, Sales, etc.
- **Permissions** - Specify what each role can view, create, edit, and delete
- **Default Role** - Set which role new users receive by default

## Steps to Complete

  <Step title="Navigate to Roles Settings">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Users** and click the **Roles** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Default Roles">
    MSPortal includes default roles to get you started. Review these to understand the permission structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Roles (Optional)">
    Click **Add Role** to create a new role. Give it a descriptive name and configure its permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
