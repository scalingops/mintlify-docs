When you first sign up for MSPortal, the **Onboarding Wizard** appears in the bottom-right corner of your screen. This guided setup walks you through configuring all the essential settings for your MSP portal.

## How It Works

The wizard tracks your progress across multiple setup steps. As you complete each step, the wizard automatically detects your progress and moves you forward.

## Minimizing the Wizard

If you need more screen space, you can minimize the wizard by clicking the minimize button in the header. Click it again to expand.

You can also temporarily dismiss the wizard using the menu, which will hide it until your next session.

## Completing Onboarding

Once you've completed all the required steps, the wizard will offer to mark your onboarding as complete. After completion, the wizard will no longer appear, though you can always access these settings through the Settings menu.

<Tip>
  You don't need to complete every step right away. Focus on the essentials first—Tenant Details, Roles, and your primary integration—then come back to configure additional features as needed.
