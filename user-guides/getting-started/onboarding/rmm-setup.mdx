The RMM Integration step connects MSPortal to your Remote Monitoring and Management system. This enables automatic synchronization of devices, sites, and monitoring data.

  This step only appears if you selected that you need an RMM integration in the Integration Selection step.

## What Gets Synced

Depending on your RMM, MSPortal can sync:

- **Devices** - Computers, servers, and network devices
