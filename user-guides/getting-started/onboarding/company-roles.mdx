Company Roles let you define job function labels for your clients' users, such as "Account Manager", "Technician", or "Help Desk". Roles are used for organization and reporting — they do **not** control portal access.

## Understanding Roles vs Permission Groups

<Warning>
Roles and Permission Groups serve different purposes. Do not confuse them.
</Warning>

| Concept | Purpose | Controls Access? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Roles** (this step) | Describe a person's job function | No |
| **Permission Groups** ([previous step](/user-guides/getting-started/onboarding/company-permission-groups)) | Control what a user can see and do | Yes |

A company user is assigned **both** a Role and a Permission Group independently. For example, two users might both have the role "Account Manager" but different permission groups — one with "Full Access" and another with "View Only".

## What You'll Configure

- **Role Names** - Create roles like "Account Manager", "Technician", "Help Desk"
- **Descriptions** - Optional descriptions explaining each role's purpose
