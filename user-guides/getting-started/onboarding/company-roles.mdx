Company Roles work with Permission Groups to control what your clients' users can do in MSPortal. While Permission Groups define module access, Roles provide a way to assign multiple permission settings to users easily.

## What You'll Configure

- **Role Names** - Create roles like "Admin", "Manager", "User"
- **Permission Group Assignment** - Link roles to permission groups
- **Default Role** - Set which role new company users receive

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Company Roles">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Companies > Roles**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Default Roles">
    MSPortal includes default company roles. Review these to understand how they're configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Roles (Optional)">
    Click **Add Role** to create a new role for specific client needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Permission Groups">
    Link each role to the appropriate permission group(s).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Default Role">
    Choose which role is automatically assigned to new company users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Roles and Permission Groups Work Together

```
Company User → Assigned Role → Permission Group → Module Access
     │              │                  │               │
   "John"      "Manager"        "Standard Access"   Tickets, Training, Devices
```

When you add a user to a company, you assign them a role. That role determines their permission group, which controls what they can see and do.

## Manual Completion

This step requires **manual completion**. Click **Mark Complete** in the wizard when you've finished setting up your company roles.

<Note>
  Company roles are different from tenant roles. Company roles are for your clients' users, while tenant roles are for your internal MSP staff.
