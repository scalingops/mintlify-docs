Company Permission Groups define what your clients' users can access when they log into MSPortal. These groups determine which modules, data, and actions are available to company users.

## Understanding Permission Groups

Permission groups are different from tenant roles:
- **Tenant Roles** - For your internal MSP team
- **Permission Groups** - For your clients' users (company users)

## What You'll Configure

- **Group Names** - Create groups like "Full Access", "Limited Access", "View Only"
- **Module Access** - Which modules company users can see
- **Data Visibility** - What data within each module is visible
- **Action Permissions** - What actions users can take (view, edit, etc.)

## Steps to Complete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Permission Groups">
    Click **Go to Settings** in the onboarding wizard, or go to **Settings > Companies > Permissions**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Default Groups">
    MSPortal includes default permission groups. Review these to understand the structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Groups (Optional)">
    Click **Add Permission Group** to create a new group for specific client needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Module Access">

  </Step>
