Company Permission Groups define what your clients' users can access when they log into MSPortal. These groups determine which modules, data, and actions are available to company users.

## Understanding Permission Groups

Permission Groups are different from both tenant roles and company roles:

| Concept | For | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Tenant Roles** | Your internal MSP team | Control staff access to MSPortal features |
| **Permission Groups** | Your clients' users | Control company user access to the portal |
| **Company Roles** | Your clients' users | Organizational labels (job titles) — do **not** control access |

<Note>
Permission Groups control access. [Company Roles](/user-guides/getting-started/onboarding/company-roles) are just organizational labels. A user is assigned both independently.
</Note>

## What You'll Configure

- **Group Names** - Create groups like "Full Access", "Standard User", "View Only"
- **Module Access** - Which modules company users can see (Tickets, Training, Devices, etc.)
- **Permission Levels** - What actions users can take: Read, Write, or Manage
- **Ticket Display Groups** - Which ticket categories are visible to this group
- **Default Group** - Which group is automatically assigned to new users

## Permission Levels

Each module supports three levels of access:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Read** | View data only |
| **Write** | Create and edit records (includes Read) |
| **Manage** | Full control including delete (includes Read and Write) |
