<Note>
**Backups** and **Security** categories only appear if you have the Cove Backup or Cork Security integrations enabled. Categories are also filtered based on your user permissions — you'll only see results you have access to.
</Note>

## Deep Search

Toggle **Deep Search** mode by clicking the sparkle button at the bottom of the search palette. Deep Search enables full-text search across all note content in MSPortal, including:

- Ticket notes
- Meeting notes
- Planner item notes
- Project notes

When Deep Search finds a match in a note, the result shows a snippet preview of the matching text and links directly to the parent item (the ticket, meeting, planner item, or project the note belongs to).

<Info>
Your Deep Search preference is remembered between sessions — toggle it once and it stays on until you turn it off.
</Info>

## Company Scoping

Search results automatically respect your currently selected companies. If you have specific companies selected in the company filter, Universal Search only returns results from those companies.

## Permissions

Universal Search respects your user permissions. You will only see results from categories your role has access to. For example, if your role doesn't include compliance permissions, compliance results won't appear in search.

## Tips

- **Use short, specific terms** for the fastest results — searching "acme" is more effective than "acme corporation LLC"
- **Navigate to pages quickly** by typing the page name, like "settings" or "training"
- **Enable Deep Search** when you need to find something mentioned in a note but can't remember which ticket or meeting it was in
- **Right-click a result** to open it in a new browser tab while keeping your current page open
