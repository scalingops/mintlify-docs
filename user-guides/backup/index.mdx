## Overview

The Backup module provides a centralized view of backup protection status across your managed devices and Microsoft 365 services. Monitor backup health, identify at-risk systems, and track storage usage through the Cove Backup integration.

<Note>
The Backup module requires an active Cove Backup integration. Configure your integration in **Settings > Integrations** to see backup data.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Cove Backup integration enabled and synced
- Appropriate user permissions to view backup data

### Accessing Backup

Navigate to **Backup** from the main sidebar. The module has three main sections accessible via tabs:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of backup health metrics
- **Devices**: Detailed device backup status
- **Microsoft 365**: Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams backup status

## Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a high-level view of your backup protection status.

### Protection Status Cards

Monitor the overall health of your backup environment with four status cards:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Protected** | Devices with successful recent backups |
| **Warning** | Devices with backup issues that need attention |
| **Failed** | Devices where backups have failed |
| **Unprotected** | Devices without backup protection |

### Storage Usage

View total backup storage consumption across all protected devices and services.

## Devices Tab

The Devices tab shows detailed backup status for all monitored workstations, servers, and other devices.

### Device Backup Information

For each device, you can view:
- Device name and type
- Company assignment
- Last successful backup timestamp
- Backup status (Protected, Warning, Failed, Unprotected)
- Storage consumption

### Filtering Devices

Use filters to focus on specific devices:
- Filter by company to see backups for a specific client
- Filter by status to identify problem areas
- Search by device name

## Microsoft 365 Tab

The Microsoft 365 tab displays backup status for cloud services:

- **Exchange**: Email and calendar backup
- **OneDrive**: Personal file storage backup
- **SharePoint**: Team sites and document libraries
- **Teams**: Teams data and conversations

### M365 Backup Details

For each user or service, view:
- User/service name
- Associated company
- Last backup timestamp
- Items backed up
- Storage used

## Common Tasks

### Syncing Backup Data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Sync Button">
    Click the **Sync** button in the page header to refresh backup data from Cove
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Sync">
    The button will show "Syncing..." while data is being refreshed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Updated Data">
    Once complete, the page will display the latest backup information
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Backup data is synced automatically on a regular schedule. Use manual sync when you need the most current information.
</Tip>

### Identifying At-Risk Devices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Start on the Dashboard tab to see overall status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Failed/Warning Cards">
    Note the counts for Failed and Warning devices
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Devices">
    Click the Devices tab and filter by "Failed" or "Warning" status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Take Action">
    For each at-risk device, investigate the cause and remediate
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monitoring Storage

View storage consumption at multiple levels:
- **Dashboard**: Total storage across all backups
- **Devices Tab**: Per-device storage breakdown
- **M365 Tab**: Per-user/service storage for cloud backups

## Understanding Backup Status

| Status | Color | Action Required |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Protected | Green | None - backups are healthy |
| Warning | Amber | Review - backup may be stale or incomplete |
| Failed | Red | Urgent - backup failures need immediate attention |
| Unprotected | Gray | Consider - device may need backup protection |

<Warning>
Failed backups should be investigated promptly. Extended periods without successful backups increase data loss risk.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Daily Review**: Check the Dashboard daily to catch backup issues early
- **Address Warnings**: Don't ignore warning status - investigate before they become failures
- **Storage Planning**: Monitor storage trends to plan for capacity needs
- **Document Exceptions**: Keep notes on any intentionally unprotected devices

## Troubleshooting

### No Backup Data Showing

If the backup pages show no data:

1. Verify your Cove Backup integration is active in **Settings > Integrations**
2. Check that the integration has completed its initial sync
3. Click the **Sync** button to refresh data manually
4. If issues persist, check the integration status for error messages

### Stale Backup Data

If data appears outdated:

1. Click the **Sync** button to trigger a manual refresh
2. Check the "Last backup check" timestamp on the Dashboard
3. Verify the Cove integration credentials are still valid
