The Projects module provides a centralized dashboard to view, manage, and monitor all your projects synced from your PSA (Professional Services Automation) platform. It displays your PSA project data while adding powerful tracking, health monitoring, and communication features.

## Overview

Projects in MSPortal are automatically synced from your connected PSA integration (ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo PSA, or Syncro). The module enhances your PSA data with:

- Visual health status tracking
- Client action management
- Weekly update posting
- Deliverable and milestone tracking
- Team contact assignments

<Note>
Projects are synced from your PSA integration. If no projects appear, ensure your PSA integration is configured in **Settings > Integrations**.
</Note>

### Summary Cards

- **Total Projects** - All projects in your portfolio
- **In Progress** - Active projects currently being worked on
- **Completed** - Successfully finished projects
- **On Hold** - Paused projects
- **Overdue** - Projects past their due date

## Creating Items from Phases & Tickets

You can quickly create deliverables, updates, and decisions directly from project phases or tickets. This automatically links the new item back to its source, making it easy to track work related to specific phases or tickets.

### From a Phase

Click the **⋯** (more options) button on any phase row to:

- **Create Deliverable** - Creates a new deliverable linked to the phase
- **Create Update** - Creates a weekly update referencing the phase
- **Decision Needed** - Creates a client action item linked to the phase

### From a Ticket

Click the **⋯** (more options) button on any ticket within a phase to:

- **Create Deliverable** - Creates a deliverable linked to the specific ticket
- **Create Update** - Creates a weekly update for the ticket
- **Decision Needed** - Creates a decision item linked to the ticket

<Tip>
When you create an item from a phase or ticket, you'll automatically be navigated to that item's tab so you can fill in the details right away.
</Tip>

### Linked Item Indicators

Items created from phases or tickets display a link indicator showing their source. This helps you:

- Trace deliverables back to the work that spawned them
- Connect updates to specific project activities
- Associate pending decisions with relevant tickets or phases

## Project Health Status

MSPortal automatically calculates project health based on:

- Days remaining vs. work completed
- Hours variance from estimate
- Overdue status

Health statuses include:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **On Track** | Project progressing well |
| **At Risk** | Minor concerns - approaching deadline or moderately over budget |
| **Behind** | Critical issues requiring attention |
| **Completed** | Project finished |

You can manually override the calculated health status and provide a reason.
