The Projects module provides a centralized dashboard to view, manage, and monitor all your projects synced from your PSA (Professional Services Automation) platform. It displays your PSA project data while adding powerful tracking, health monitoring, and communication features.

## Overview

Projects in MSPortal are automatically synced from your connected PSA integration (ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo PSA, or Syncro). The module enhances your PSA data with:

- Visual kanban boards for project and ticket management
- Health status tracking and variance indicators
- Client action management
- Weekly update posting with AI assistance
- Deliverable and milestone tracking
- Phase and ticket views with time entry details
- Team contact assignments

<Note>
Projects are synced from your PSA integration. If no projects appear, ensure your PSA integration is configured in **Settings > Integrations**.
</Note>

## Projects Dashboard

The main dashboard displays all your projects with at-a-glance metrics.

### Summary Cards

At the top of the dashboard, summary cards show:

- **Total Projects** - All projects in your portfolio
- **In Progress** - Active projects currently being worked on
- **Completed** - Successfully finished projects
- **On Hold** - Paused projects
- **Overdue** - Projects past their due date
- **Over Budget** - Projects exceeding estimated hours

### View Options

Toggle between two display modes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Kanban View">
    The kanban view displays projects as cards organized by status columns. This view is ideal for:

    - Visualizing project pipeline at a glance
    - Quickly moving projects between statuses
    - Seeing project health via color-coded indicators

    Each column represents a status group (Not Started, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled), and you can drag projects between columns to update their status.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Table View">
    The table view shows projects in a compact tabular format with:

    - Sortable columns
    - Quick filtering
    - More projects visible at once

    Best for scanning many projects quickly or when you need detailed sorting/filtering.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Filtering Projects

Use the search bar and filters to find specific projects:

- **Search** - Find projects by name
- **Status Filter** - Filter by Not Started, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, or Cancelled

## Projects Kanban Board

The kanban board provides a visual way to manage your project portfolio by status.

### Understanding Columns

Projects are organized into columns based on their lifecycle status:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Not Started** | Projects that haven't begun yet |
| **In Progress** | Active projects being worked on |
| **On Hold** | Paused projects awaiting action |
| **Completed** | Successfully finished projects |
| **Cancelled** | Projects that were terminated |

<Tip>
You can customize which PSA statuses map to each column in **Settings > Projects**. This allows you to group similar statuses together.
</Tip>

### Project Cards

Each project card displays key information at a glance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Status & Health" icon="heart-pulse">
    Color-coded left border indicates health status (green = On Track, yellow = At Risk, red = Behind). Status badge shows lifecycle stage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progress Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    Visual progress bar showing percentage of hours completed vs. estimated.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hours & Variance" icon="clock">
    Actual hours vs. estimated with variance badges showing if under (green) or over (red) budget.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timeline" icon="calendar">
    Due date displayed with overdue dates highlighted in red.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Moving Projects Between Statuses

To change a project's status using the kanban board:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag the Project Card">
    Click and hold the drag handle on the project card, then drag it to the target column.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Target Status">
    If multiple PSA statuses are mapped to the target column, a modal appears asking you to select the specific status.

    If only one status is mapped, the project moves automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Change">
    The project card immediately moves to the new column (optimistic update), and the status is synced to your PSA.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
If you drag a project to a column with an unmapped status and you have settings permissions, MSPortal will offer to add that status to the column mapping automatically.
</Info>

## Creating Items from Phases & Tickets

You can quickly create deliverables, updates, and decisions directly from project phases or tickets. This automatically links the new item back to its source, making it easy to track work related to specific phases or tickets.

### From a Phase

Click the **⋯** (more options) button on any phase row to:

- **Create Deliverable** - Creates a new deliverable linked to the phase
- **Create Update** - Creates a weekly update referencing the phase
- **Decision Needed** - Creates a client action item linked to the phase

### From a Ticket

Click the **⋯** (more options) button on any ticket within a phase to:

- **Create Deliverable** - Creates a deliverable linked to the specific ticket
- **Create Update** - Creates a weekly update for the ticket
- **Decision Needed** - Creates a decision item linked to the ticket

<Tip>
When you create an item from a phase or ticket, you'll automatically be navigated to that item's tab so you can fill in the details right away.
</Tip>

### Linked Item Indicators

Items created from phases or tickets display a link indicator showing their source. This helps you:

- Trace deliverables back to the work that spawned them
- Connect updates to specific project activities
- Associate pending decisions with relevant tickets or phases

## Project Health Status

MSPortal automatically calculates project health based on:

- Days remaining vs. work completed
- Hours variance from estimate
- Overdue status

Health statuses include:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **On Track** | Project progressing well |
| **At Risk** | Minor concerns - approaching deadline or moderately over budget |
| **Behind** | Critical issues requiring attention |
| **Completed** | Project finished |

You can manually override the calculated health status and provide a reason.

## Editing Projects

Users with project management permissions can edit project details:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Details">
    Click on a project card to open the detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Edit Details">
    Click the **Edit Details** button in the project header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Information">
