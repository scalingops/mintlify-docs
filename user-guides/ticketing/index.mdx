The Tickets module provides comprehensive ticket management integrated with your PSA system. Create tickets using AI assistance, manage templates, and track ticket status all from one interface.

<Note>
The Tickets interface adapts based on your PSA integration (ConnectWise, Halo PSA, Autotask, or Syncro). Some features and field names may vary depending on your connected PSA system.
</Note>

## Accessing Tickets

1. Click **Tickets** in the sidebar
2. The ticket list displays all tickets for the selected company

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ticketing/tickets-list-overview.png" alt="Tickets List Overview" />
</Frame>

The tickets list provides a centralized view of all support tickets across your organization. When viewing in **Global View** (accessible from the company selector at the top of the page), you'll see tickets from all companies. When a specific company is selected, the list automatically filters to show only that company's tickets.

## Tickets List

The ticket list displays essential information at a glance, including ticket numbers, summaries, status, priority, assigned technicians, and timestamps. Each row is color-coded by status and priority to help you quickly identify urgent issues.

### Menu Options

Click the **Tickets Menu** dropdown to switch between views:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ticketing/tickets-menu-dropdown.png" alt="Tickets Menu Dropdown" />
</Frame>

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All Tickets** | View and manage all tickets from your connected PSA systems |
| **Templates** | Access and manage ticket templates for standardized ticket creation |

### Filtering Tickets

The filter bar provides powerful search and filtering capabilities to help you find specific tickets quickly:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search** | Free-text search across ticket number, summary, and description. Useful for finding tickets by keyword or reference number |
| **Status** | Filter by ticket status (e.g., Open, Closed, Pending). Multi-select allows viewing tickets in multiple states simultaneously |
| **Priority** | Filter by priority level to focus on critical issues first |
| **Assigned To** | Filter by assigned technician to view your team's workload or your own tickets |
| **Date Range** | Filter by creation or last update date using preset ranges (Today, This Week, Last Month) or custom date ranges |
| **Company** | Filter by associated company, particularly useful when viewing all tickets in Global View |

<Tip>
Combine multiple filters to narrow down results. For example, filter by "Open" status + "High" priority + "Assigned To: Me" to see your urgent open tickets.
</Tip>

### Column Preferences

Customize which columns display in the tickets table to match your workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Columns Button">
    Click the **Columns** button in the toolbar above the ticket list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Visibility">
    Use the eye icons next to each column name to show or hide columns. Hidden columns are grayed out
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder Columns">
    Drag columns using the grip handle on the left side to reorder them according to your preference
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ticketing/tickets-columns-dialog.png" alt="Column Preferences" />
</Frame>

Your column preferences are saved automatically and persist across sessions. Available columns include:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ticket #** | Unique ticket identifier from your PSA system. Click to view ticket details |
| **Summary** | Brief ticket description (truncated in list view, full text visible in detail view) |
| **Status** | Current ticket state with color-coded badge for quick visual identification |
| **Priority** | Urgency level with color coding (red for critical, orange for high, yellow for medium, blue for low) |
| **Source** | PSA system the ticket originated from (ConnectWise, Halo, Autotask, or Syncro) |
| **Company** | Associated client company |
| **Assigned To** | Responsible technician or team |
| **Created** | Creation timestamp showing when the ticket was opened |
| **Updated** | Last modified timestamp, useful for tracking recent activity |
| **SLA Status** | Service level agreement status showing if deadlines are at risk |
| **Category** | Ticket category or type as defined in your PSA |

### Pagination

For organizations with many tickets, the list uses server-side pagination to ensure fast loading times. Navigation controls at the bottom of the list let you:
- Jump to the first or last page
- Navigate to the next or previous page
- See your current position (e.g., "Page 2 of 15, 367 total tickets")

## Creating a New Ticket

### Starting a New Ticket

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click New Ticket">
    Click the **New Ticket** button in the top right corner of the tickets page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use AI Assistant (Optional)">
    Describe the issue in natural language in the AI Assistant panel. You can type or use voice input to dictate the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Template">
    Choose a template from the dropdown to pre-fill the form with appropriate fields, or let AI select the best template based on your description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill Details">
    Complete the required fields in each section. AI-populated fields are highlighted and can be edited if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Create Ticket** to submit the ticket to your PSA system
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ticketing/tickets-new-form.png" alt="New Ticket Form" />
</Frame>

The new ticket form is divided into two main panels:
- **Left Panel**: AI Assistant for natural language ticket creation
- **Right Panel**: Template selection and field entry

### AI Assistant

The AI Assistant revolutionizes ticket creation by understanding natural language descriptions and automatically populating form fields:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Natural Language Processing** | Describe the issue conversationally. For example: "Customer John from Acme Corp called - their email stopped working this morning and they can't send or receive messages. It's urgent because they have client meetings today." |
| **Voice Input** | Click the microphone button to dictate the issue hands-free. The AI transcribes your speech in real-time and shows interim results as you speak |
| **Intelligent Template Selection** | AI analyzes your description and selects the most appropriate template automatically |
| **Auto-Fill Fields** | AI extracts details like contact name, email, phone, issue description, urgency, and impact from your description and populates corresponding fields |
| **Smart Suggestions** | Based on the issue type, AI suggests appropriate categories, priorities, and even follow-up questions for gathering additional information |

<Tip>
For best results with AI ticket creation, include as much context as possible in your description: who reported the issue, what the problem is, when it started, how urgent it is, and any relevant contact information.
</Tip>

After AI generates the ticket details, you'll see a summary showing:
- **Fields filled**: Which fields were automatically populated
- **Required fields remaining**: Any mandatory fields you still need to complete
- **Optional fields available**: Additional fields you can fill in if needed
- **Follow-up questions**: Suggested questions to gather more information

<Warning>
While AI saves time, it may occasionally misinterpret information. Always review AI-populated fields before submitting to ensure accuracy.
</Warning>

### Using Templates

Templates provide pre-configured forms for common ticket types, ensuring consistency and capturing all necessary information:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ticketing/tickets-detail-dialog.png" alt="Ticket Detail Dialog" />
</Frame>

The ticket detail view is organized into a two-column layout:

2. Select the new status from the available options
3. The change syncs automatically to your PSA system

<Note>
Available status options depend on your PSA configuration and the ticket's current board or queue. Some workflows may restrict which status transitions are allowed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Ticket">
    Click the ticket row to open the detail panel

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If you close the detail panel with unsaved note content, you'll be prompted to confirm. Save your work before closing to avoid losing your changes.
</Warning>

### Activity Log

The Activity section provides a complete history of ticket interactions:
- **Notes**: All communication and updates added by technicians
