   - Priority levels
   - Date ranges
   - Assigned technician

### Ticket Information

Each synchronized ticket displays:
- **Ticket Number** - PSA ticket identifier
- **Summary** - Brief description
- **Status** - Current ticket state
- **Priority** - Urgency level
- **Company** - Associated client
- **Assigned To** - Responsible technician
- **Created/Updated** - Timestamps
- **Time Entries** - Logged hours (if available)

### Analytics & Reporting

The Ticketing module provides:
- **Ticket Volume** - Trends over time
- **Resolution Times** - Average time to close

## Best Practices

- **Regular Sync** - Ensure synchronization runs frequently

- **Permission Management** - Limit ticket visibility as needed

## Limitations
