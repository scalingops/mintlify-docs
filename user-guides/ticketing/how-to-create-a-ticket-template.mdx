Ticket templates streamline repetitive ticket creation by providing pre-configured forms with custom fields. This guide covers creating templates using AI assistance or manual configuration, managing company-specific branches, and importing/exporting templates.

## Prerequisites

- You must have "Manage Tickets" permission
- PSA integration should be configured if using external ticketing systems
- Categories should be set up in Ticket Settings

## Creating a New Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Templates">
    Go to **Tickets** in the sidebar, click the menu button, and select **Templates**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Template">
    Click the **New Template** button in the top-right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Template Details">
    Fill in the basic information:
    - **Template Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "New Employee Setup")
    - **Category**: Select from available categories

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Template Configuration Sections

The template editor is organized into expandable accordion sections:

| **Template Name** | Display name shown when selecting the template |
| **Category** | Group templates by type (Incident, Service Request, etc.) |

### Company Visibility

Control which companies can see and use this template:

**Default Visibility Setting:**

At the top of the visibility section, configure the default behavior for new companies:
- **Enabled (default)**: New companies automatically have access to this template
- **Disabled**: New companies must be manually enabled

**Per-Company Controls:**

Each company can be individually toggled on or off:
- Search for companies using the search box
- Toggle the switch to enable or disable access
- Companies with branches are highlighted with a branch indicator

**Bulk Actions:**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enable All** | Grant access to all companies |
| **Disable All** | Revoke access from all companies |
| **Enable All Except Branched** | Enable for all companies that don't have a custom branch (recommended when using branches) |

<Tip>
When using company branches, click **Enable All Except Branched** to ensure companies with custom branches use their branch while all other companies use the parent template.
</Tip>

<Note>
Companies with branches are shown with an orange branch badge. These companies will use their branch version regardless of whether the parent template is enabled for them.
</Note>

### Company Branches

Create company-specific versions of a template with customized fields and settings.

<Info>
Company branches allow you to customize a template for specific companies while keeping the parent template as the default for all other companies. Branches inherit the parent template structure but can have different fields, labels, help text, and PSA routing.
</Info>

**When to Use Branches:**

- A client needs additional custom fields not relevant to other companies
- A client requires different PSA routing (different board, queue, or priority)
- A client wants simplified fields with some sections hidden
- A client needs different field labels or terminology

**Creating a Branch:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand Company Branches">
    Click the **Company Branches** accordion section in the template editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Branch">
    Click the **Create Branch** button in the top-right of the section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search and Select Company">
    Use the search box to find the company, then click to select it. Companies that already have branches are not shown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create & Edit">
    Click **Create & Edit** to create a full copy of the template and open it for editing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Editing a Branch:**

When editing a branch, you can:
- Add, remove, or modify fields and sections
- Change field labels, help text, and default values
- Configure different PSA routing settings
- Give the branch a custom name (optional)

The branch is a complete, independent copy of the parent template. Changes to the parent template do not affect existing branches.

**Managing Branches:**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Edit Branch** | Click the external link icon to open the branch in the template editor |
| **Delete Branch** | Click the trash icon, then confirm. The company reverts to the parent template |
| **View Status** | Inactive branches are labeled with a badge |

**Viewing Branches from the Template List:**

In the Templates table, templates with branches show an expandable row. Click the chevron to see all company branches for that template, including:
- Branch name and company name
- Number of companies with visibility enabled/disabled
- Quick actions to edit or delete each branch

<Warning>
Deleting a branch is permanent and cannot be undone. The company will immediately revert to using the parent template.
</Warning>

### Import / Export

Export templates for backup or sharing, or import templates from JSON/CSV files. Access the Import/Export dialog from the accordion section in the template editor or from the row actions menu in the templates list.

**Export Options:**

    - Removed sections and fields (red)

    Review the diff before confirming to understand exactly what will change.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CSV Import">
    Update existing field properties from a CSV file.

    **Requirements:**

## Using AI to Generate Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Designer">
    Click the floating purple **AI** button on the right side of the screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Template">
    Type a description of what the template should do, e.g., "Create a template for new employee onboarding that captures hardware needs, software requirements, and access permissions."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Generated Fields">
    The AI will create sections and fields based on your description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize as Needed">
    Modify, add, or remove fields to match your exact requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The AI designer works iteratively. You can request changes like "Add a section for emergency contacts" and it will modify the existing template.
</Tip>

## Saving and Activating

1. Review all sections and fields
2. Ensure PSA settings are configured if using integrations
3. Click **Save Template**
4. Enable the **Active** toggle to make the template available

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name templates clearly so users can quickly identify the right one. Include the purpose in the name (e.g., "Password Reset - Standard" vs "Password Reset - VIP").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group Related Fields">
    Organize fields into logical sections. Users can collapse sections they don't need, making long forms more manageable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Conditional Fields">
    Reduce form clutter by showing fields only when relevant. For example, show "Manager Approval" only when the request is over a certain budget.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Activating">
    Create templates as inactive, test with a few tickets, then activate once you're confident the fields capture the right information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Branches Sparingly">
    Only create company branches when there are significant differences. Minor variations can often be handled with conditional fields.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Template not appearing** | Verify the template is marked as Active |
| **Conditional field not showing** | Check the trigger field and value are correctly configured |
| **PSA fields not loading** | Verify your PSA integration is connected and synced |
| **Branch not saving** | Ensure you have permission to manage templates |
| **Import fails** | Check JSON format matches export format; CSV requires existing template |
