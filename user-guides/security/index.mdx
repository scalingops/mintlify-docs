The Security module displays data synced from your Cork integration, giving you a centralized view of compliance events, software vulnerabilities, and endpoint information across all your managed clients.

## Overview

The Security module is organized into three main tabs:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Compliance" icon="shield-check">
    View security compliance events and alerts from your clients
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vulnerabilities" icon="bug">
    Track software vulnerabilities with CVE details and CVSS scores
  </Card>
  <Card title="Endpoints" icon="desktop">
    Monitor devices and endpoints across your client base
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Accessing the Security Module

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Security">
    Click **Cork** in the main sidebar to access the Security module.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Tab">
    Use the tabs at the top to switch between **Compliance**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Endpoints** views.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by Company">
    Use the company selector in the header to view data for a specific company or all companies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Before using the Security module, you must:

1. **Set up the Cork integration** - Connect your Cork account via **Settings > Integrations**
2. **Map clients to companies** - Link your Cork clients to MSPortal companies
3. **Run initial sync** - Allow the initial data sync to complete

<Note>
Data is automatically synced from Cork on a regular schedule. Compliance events sync every 30 minutes, and other data types sync hourly.
</Note>

## Compliance Tab

The Compliance tab displays security compliance events from Cork, including alerts and findings that require attention.

### Filtering Compliance Events

Use the filters to narrow down compliance events:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Company** | Filter by specific company |
| **Event Type** | Filter by compliance event category |
| **At Risk** | Show only events marked as "at risk" |
| **Resolved** | Filter by resolved/unresolved status |
| **Date Range** | Filter by when the event was created |

### Understanding Compliance Events

Each compliance event includes:

- **Event Type** - The category of compliance finding
- **Entity** - The affected device, inbox, or domain
- **Status** - Whether the item is at risk or OK
- **Resolved** - Whether the issue has been addressed
- **Created Date** - When Cork first detected the issue

## Vulnerabilities Tab

The Vulnerabilities tab shows software vulnerabilities detected across your client endpoints, complete with CVE identifiers and severity scores.

### Vulnerability Details

Each vulnerability entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **CVE ID** | The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier |
| **Software** | The affected software product and version |
| **CVSS Score** | Severity score from 0.0 to 10.0 |
| **Priority** | Cork's recommended remediation priority (Critical, Accelerated, Routine) |
| **Known Exploited** | Whether this vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild |

### Filtering Vulnerabilities

Available filters include:

- **Search** - Find vulnerabilities by CVE ID or software name
- **Company** - Filter by specific company
- **Priority** - Filter by Critical, Accelerated, or Routine
- **Known Exploited** - Show only actively exploited vulnerabilities
- **CVSS Range** - Filter by minimum/maximum CVSS score

<Warning>
Vulnerabilities marked as **Known Exploited** should be prioritized for immediate remediation as they are actively being targeted by attackers.
</Warning>

## Endpoints Tab

The Endpoints tab provides visibility into all devices and endpoints synced from Cork.

### Endpoint Information

Each endpoint entry displays:

- **Device Name** - The name of the device
- **Hostname** - The network hostname
- **Operating System** - OS type and version
- **IP Addresses** - Network addresses
- **Last Seen** - When Cork last received data from this endpoint
- **Company** - The associated client company

### Filtering Endpoints

Use the search bar to find endpoints by:
- Device name
- Hostname
- IP address

## Bulk Actions

You can select multiple items across any tab to perform bulk actions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Items">
    Click the checkbox next to items you want to act on, or use the header checkbox to select all visible items.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Bulk Actions">
    When items are selected, a **Bulk Actions** dropdown appears in the header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Action">
    Select an action like **Add to Planner** to create work items for the selected security findings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Items to Planner

Convert security findings into actionable work items by adding them to the Planner. See the [Adding Security Items to Planner](/user-guides/security/add-to-planner) guide for detailed instructions.
