This guide walks you through connecting your Cove (N-able Backup) instance to MSPortal.ai using our streamlined setup wizard.

## Prerequisites

- Active Cove (N-able Backup) account with administrative access
- MSPortal.ai account with integration management permissions

## Part 1: Configure Cove

Before connecting to MSPortal.ai, you need to create an API user in Cove with the appropriate permissions.

### Create API User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access User Management">
    Log into your Cove (N-able Backup) management console and navigate to **Users** in the main menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to API Users">
    Click on **API Users** to access the API user management section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New API User">
    Click **Add API Users** to begin creating your API user.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Customer">
    In the customer selection dropdown, select your company/partner name. This is the account that the API user will be associated with.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure User Details">
    Configure the following settings:

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Login Name** | `MSPortal` (or any descriptive name) |
    | **Role** | `Supporter` |

    <Tip>
      The Supporter role provides the necessary read permissions for MSPortal to sync your backup data without granting excessive access.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Copy Token">
    Click **Save** to create the API user. The system will generate an API token.

    <Warning>
      **Copy the API token immediately!** You will not be able to retrieve it again after leaving this page. Store it securely for use in MSPortal.ai.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Required Information

Before proceeding to MSPortal, ensure you have the following:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Partner Name** | Your company name as shown in the Cove management console |
| **API User Name** | The login name you created (e.g., `MSPortal`) |
| **API Token** | The token generated when creating the API user |

## Part 2: MSPortal Setup Wizard

MSPortal.ai provides a guided setup wizard that walks you through connecting and configuring your Cove integration in 3 easy steps.

### Starting the Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In MSPortal.ai, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Setup">
    Find the **Cove Backup** integration card and click **Configure** to launch the setup wizard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 1: Connect

Enter your Cove API credentials to establish the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    Fill in the following fields:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Partner Name** | Your company name as shown in the Cove management console |
    | **API User Name** | The login name of your API user (e.g., `MSPortal`) |
    | **API Token** | The token you copied when creating the API user |

    <Note>
      The API User Name is the login name you created, not an email address.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. You'll see a green "Connection successful" message when successful.

    If the connection fails:
    - Verify your Partner Name matches exactly as shown in Cove
    - Check that your API User Name is correct (the login name, not email)
    - Ensure the API token is copied correctly without extra spaces
    - Verify the API user has the Supporter role
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Integration">
    Once the connection test passes, click **Create Integration** to save your credentials and proceed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Map Partners

Map Cove partners (clients/customers) to your MSPortal companies. This determines which backup data syncs to which company.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sync Partners">
    If no partners appear, click **Sync** to fetch partners from your Cove account. The initial sync may take a few minutes depending on your account size.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Quick Match">
    Click **Quick Match** to automatically match Cove partners to MSPortal companies based on name similarity. This saves time when you have many partners with matching names.

    <Tip>
      Quick Match uses intelligent name matching to find likely matches. Review the results and make manual adjustments as needed.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual Mapping">
    For partners that weren't automatically matched or need adjustment:

    1. Find the partner in the list
    2. Click the **Select company** dropdown in the "Mapped To" column
    3. Search for and select the correct MSPortal company

    To remove a mapping, click the **X** button next to the company badge.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Partners">
    Use the filter dropdown to view:
    - **All Partners** - Show all synced partners
    - **Mapped Only** - Show only partners linked to companies
    - **Unmapped Only** - Show partners that still need mapping
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Once you've mapped the partners you need, click **Next** to continue.

    <Info>
      Only devices from mapped partners will be available for import. You can return to add more mappings at any time.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Import Devices

Import backup devices from Cove into your MSPortal asset inventory.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Device Import">
    Click **Open Device Import** to access the full device import interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Devices">
    From the device import page, you can:
    - View all backup agents from your mapped partners
    - Filter by partner or status
    - Selectively import devices to your asset inventory
    - Sync device data to keep information current

    <Note>
      The initial device sync may take a few minutes depending on the number of backup agents in your account.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Integration

After setup, you can manage your integration from **Settings** > **Integrations**:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Configure** | Re-open the setup wizard to modify settings or add more partner mappings |
| **Sync Partners** | Refresh the list of partners from Cove |
| **Import Devices** | Access the device import page to import backup agents |

---

## Synchronization Process

### Initial Sync
- Partner data will sync when you first click the Sync button
- Devices sync separately and may take a few minutes
- Only devices from mapped partners are available for import

### Ongoing Sync
- Device status and backup data are synced automatically
- Partner mappings persist until you change them
- New partners will appear after running a sync

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify Partner Name, API User Name, and Token are correct |
| No partners appear | Click "Sync Partners" to fetch data from Cove |
| Devices not showing | Ensure the partner is mapped to a company first |
| Quick Match didn't work | Use manual mapping for partners with different names in Cove vs MSPortal |
| Token expired/invalid | Create a new API user in Cove and update the integration |

---

## Important Notes

- **Token Security**: Store your API token securely. If compromised, delete the API user in Cove and create a new one
- **Partner Mapping**: Only devices from mapped partners will sync to MSPortal
- **Role Permissions**: The Supporter role provides read-only access, which is sufficient for MSPortal integration
- **Sync Timing**: Initial synchronization may take several minutes depending on your account size
