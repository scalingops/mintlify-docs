This guide walks you through connecting your Autotask PSA instance to MSPortal.ai using our streamlined setup wizard.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to Autotask, or API credentials (username and secret)
- Admin access to MSPortal.ai with integration management permissions

## Part 1: Configure Autotask PSA

Before connecting to MSPortal.ai, you need to create an API user and security role in Autotask.

### Create Security Role

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Security Settings">
    1. Navigate to [Autotask](https://ww2.autotask.net)
    2. Go to the Admin area
    3. Click **Account Settings & Users**
    4. Click **Security Levels**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create MSPortal Security Role">
    1. Copy the default **API User (system)** role
    2. Rename it to **MSPortal**
    3. Scroll down to **Other** and enable:
       - **Can create webhooks**: Yes
       - Set webhook limit to **25**

    <Note>
      We recommend setting unused areas to "No permissions" or "Read only" to follow the principle of least privilege. However, this may cause synchronization issues if you later enable those features.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the Role">
    Click **Save & Close** to finalize the security role settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create API User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Users">
    1. Go back to **Account Settings & Users**
    2. Select **Resources/Users**
    3. Click to add a new **API user**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API User">
    Fill in the following details:

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **First Name** | MSPortal |
    | **Last Name** | Integration |
    | **Security Level** | MSPortal (the role you created) |
    | **Email Address** | Use an internal alias for receiving integration logs |
    | **Primary Internal Location** | Select your headquarters |
    | **Integration Vendor** | MSPortal.ai |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate API Credentials">
    1. Under **Credentials**, click **Generate Key**
    2. Click **Generate Secret**
    3. **Important:** Save the API username and secret immediately - the secret cannot be retrieved later

    <Warning>
      Make sure to copy and save your API credentials before closing this dialog. The secret cannot be viewed again after creation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Associate Lines of Business">
    Associate the appropriate lines of business with the API user, then click **Save & Close**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1: Connect

  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    Fill in the following fields:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **API Username** | Your Autotask API user email (e.g., `api.user@yourdomain.com`) |
    | **API Secret** | The API secret generated for your API user |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. You'll see a green "Connected" status when successful.

    <Note>
      If the connection fails, verify your API username and secret are correct and that the API user has the MSPortal security role assigned.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Once connected, click **Next** to continue to sync configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Sync

Configure what data to sync from Autotask and set up automatic contact import.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Data Sync Options">
    Enable or disable the following sync options:

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Sync Users** | Sync user/contact data from Autotask |
    | **Sync Companies** | Sync company/account data from Autotask |
    | **Enable Ticket Sync** | Sync tickets from Autotask |

    If you want contacts to be automatically imported when companies are added:

    1. Enable **Auto-Import** to automatically create user accounts for active contacts
    2. Select a **Default Role for Imported Contacts** (e.g., Viewer)

    <Tip>
      We recommend choosing a role with minimal permissions (basic ticket creation only) if you plan to import all contacts.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Ticket Sync Scope">
    Define which tickets to sync:

    | Setting | Description |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Click **Next** to continue to ticket and opportunity configuration.

### Step 4: Import (Optional)

Import users and companies from Autotask. This step is optional - you can skip it and import later from the respective settings pages.

    Import resources (your MSP staff) from Autotask to create user accounts.

    1. Enable **Import Users Now**
    2. Select users from the list to create accounts for
    3. Choose a default role for imported users

    <Note>
      Client contacts are not imported here. They can be managed via Company settings after companies are imported.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Import Companies">
    Import accounts from Autotask to sync their data.

    1. Enable **Import Companies Now**
    2. Select companies to import or link to existing MSPortal companies

### Complete Setup

Click **Complete Setup** to finish the wizard. Your Autotask integration is now configured!

<Note>
You can return to the setup wizard at any time by clicking **Configure** on the Autotask integration card. The wizard will resume with your current settings.

## Managing Your Integration

After setup, you can manage your integration from **Settings** > **Integrations**:

- **Resync**: Trigger a manual sync of data
- **Sync PSA Data**: Refresh configuration data (boards, statuses, types) from Autotask

### Webhook Management

MSPortal automatically provisions webhooks in Autotask to sync ticket and company changes instantly. If webhooks stop working:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Click the **Provision Autotask Webhooks** button to re-provision them

---

## Additional Configuration

After completing the wizard, you may want to configure additional settings:

### Configure Ticket Settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Tickets** to:

1. Set the **Delivery Method** to **PSA**
2. Ensure **Autotask** is selected as your PSA provider
3. Configure ticket categories and map them to Autotask ticket types
4. Set **Ticket Defaults** for tickets created from compliance tasks or automation

<Tip>
  Ticket defaults are also used as the starting point for new ticket templates, making template creation faster.
</Tip>

### Configure Display Groups

Display groups control which ticket fields users can see based on their role.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Tickets**
2. Scroll to **Display Groups** and click **Create Group**
3. Configure:
   - Name for the display group
   - Select **Autotask** as the PSA provider
   - Assign roles that should use this display group
   - Select which fields are visible

<Warning>
  Only grant access to information users need for their role. Follow the principle of least privilege.
</Warning>

### Configure Allowed Statuses

Set which ticket statuses users can select when updating tickets:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Tickets**
2. Configure status permissions for each display group

<Tip>
  We recommend preventing users from closing tickets directly. Instead, use a "Ready for Review" status to ensure tickets are reviewed before closure.
</Tip>

| Tickets not syncing | Check that the correct queues and categories are selected in Ticket Sync Scope. |
| Webhooks not working | Click "Provision Autotask Webhooks" to re-provision them. Ensure your API user can create webhooks. |
| Missing data | Verify the API user has appropriate permissions in the MSPortal security role. |
