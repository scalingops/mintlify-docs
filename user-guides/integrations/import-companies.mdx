## Important Notes

- **Data Sync**: Imported companies maintain a connection to your PSA system for ongoing synchronization
- **Duplicate Prevention**: MSPortal.ai automatically prevents duplicate company imports
- **Bulk Operations**: You can import multiple companies at once to save time
- **Updates**: Company data can be refreshed from your PSA at any time using the sync features

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any companies available for import:
1. Verify your integration is properly configured and connected
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions in both MSPortal.ai and your PSA system
3. Ensure your PSA contains active company records

## Next Steps

After importing companies, you can:
- Configure company-specific settings
- Import users associated with each company
- Set up company-specific compliance requirements
- Configure billing and budget settings
