This guide walks you through creating a dedicated role and API-only agent in Halo PSA for the MSPortal.ai integration. Using a custom role with specific permissions ensures a secure, least-privilege connection.

## Prerequisites

Before creating the custom role and user:

- Administrator access to your Halo PSA instance
- Access to Configuration area in Halo PSA
- Completed the initial [Halo PSA Integration setup](/user-guides/integrations/enable-halo-integration) (Client ID and Secret created)

<Info>
Creating a dedicated MSPortal role and API-only agent is **recommended** for security best practices. This ensures the integration has only the permissions it needs and provides clear audit trails.
