## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|

| Tickets not syncing | Check that the correct teams are selected in Ticket Sync Scope and that ticket statuses aren't excluded. |
| Contacts not importing | Verify Auto-Import is enabled and a default role is selected in the Sync step. |
| Permission errors | Review the API permissions in Halo PSA and ensure all required permissions are enabled. |
