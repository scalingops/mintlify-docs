## Part 2: MSPortal Setup Wizard

MSPortal.ai provides a guided setup wizard that walks you through connecting and configuring your Syncro integration in 4 easy steps.

### Starting the Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In MSPortal.ai, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Setup">
    Find the **Syncro** integration card and click **Configure** to launch the setup wizard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 1: Connect

Enter your Syncro API credentials to establish the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    Fill in the following fields:

    | Field | Description | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Syncro Subdomain** | Your Syncro subdomain (from yourcompany.syncromsp.com) | `yourcompany` |
    | **API Key** | The API token you created in Syncro | `your-api-token` |

    <Note>
      Enter only the subdomain portion. For example, if your Syncro URL is `acme.syncromsp.com`, enter just `acme`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. You'll see a green "Connected" status when successful.

    If the connection fails:
    - Verify your subdomain is correct (just the subdomain, not the full URL)
    - Check that your API key is copied correctly
    - Ensure the API token has all required permissions
    - Verify the API token hasn't expired
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Once connected, click **Next** to continue to sync configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 2: Sync

Configure what data to sync from Syncro and set up automatic contact import.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Data Sync Options">
    Enable or disable the following sync options:

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Sync Users** | Sync user/contact data from Syncro |
    | **Sync Companies** | Sync customer data from Syncro |
    | **Enable Ticket Sync** | Sync tickets from Syncro |

    <Note>
      Syncro does not support opportunity sync. Use the Planner module in MSPortal to manage sales opportunities separately.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Contact Auto-Import">
    If you want contacts to be automatically imported when companies are added:

    1. Enable **Auto-Import** to automatically create user accounts for active contacts
    2. Select a **Default Role for Imported Contacts** (e.g., Viewer)

    <Tip>
      All auto-imported contacts will be assigned the selected role. You can change individual user roles later in Settings > Users.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Ticket Sync Scope">
    Define which tickets to sync:

    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | **Exclude Statuses** | Select ticket statuses to exclude from sync (e.g., Closed, Resolved) |

    <Info>
      When you proceed to the next step, data sync will begin in the background. This may take a few minutes depending on the amount of data in your Syncro account.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Click **Next** to continue to ticket configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Step 3: Configure

Set up ticket status mapping.

#### Ticket Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Status Settings">
    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | **Closed Statuses** | Select statuses that indicate a ticket is closed |
    | **Client Comment Status** | Status to set when a client comments on a ticket |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Resolution Status Stepper">
    The Resolution Status Stepper provides a visual indicator of ticket progress. Map your Syncro statuses to each stage:

    | Stage | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **New** | Tickets that are newly created or not yet triaged |
    | **Triaged** | Tickets that have been reviewed and categorized |
    | **Working** | Tickets actively being worked on |
    | **Waiting** | Tickets waiting for customer response or external input |
    | **Resolved** | Tickets that have been completed |

    <Tip>
      You can map multiple Syncro statuses to each stage. The stepper will show the appropriate stage based on the ticket's current status.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Actions">
    Use these buttons to manage ticket sync:

    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Quick Sync** | Trigger an immediate sync of ticket data |
    | **Clear & Resync** | Delete all synced tickets and perform a fresh sync (useful after major configuration changes) |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proceed">
    Click **Next** to continue to the import step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Import (Optional)

Import users and companies from Syncro. This step is optional - you can skip it and import later from the respective settings pages.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Import Users">
    Import users from Syncro to create user accounts.

    1. Enable **Import Users Now**
    2. Select users from the list to create accounts for
    3. Choose a default role for imported users

    <Note>
      Client contacts are not imported here. They can be managed via Company settings after companies are imported.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Import Companies">
    Import customers from Syncro to sync their data.

    1. Enable **Import Companies Now**
    2. Select companies to import or link to existing MSPortal companies

    <Tip>
      Companies will sync automatically based on your sync settings. Use this option if you want to import specific companies immediately.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Complete Setup

Click **Complete Setup** to finish the wizard. Your Syncro integration is now configured!

<Note>
You can return to the setup wizard at any time by clicking **Configure** on the Syncro integration card. The wizard will resume with your current settings.
</Note>

---

## Managing Your Integration

After setup, you can manage your integration from **Settings** > **Integrations**:

- **Configure**: Re-open the setup wizard to modify settings
- **Resync**: Trigger a manual sync of data
- **Sync PSA Data**: Refresh configuration data from Syncro
- **Import Devices**: Import devices/assets from Syncro

---

## Synchronization Process

### Initial Sync
- Customer data will begin synchronizing within approximately 1 minute
- Tickets and users will sync alongside customer data
- Devices and additional settings will sync after customers have been imported

### Manual Sync
To force an immediate synchronization of specific data types, use the refresh button in the integration settings.

---

## Important Notes

- **Token Security**: Store your API token securely. If compromised, immediately revoke it in Syncro and generate a new one
- **Sync Timing**: Initial synchronization may take several minutes depending on data volume
- **Dependencies**: Devices and certain settings require customer data to be imported first
- **No Opportunities**: Syncro does not support opportunities. Use MSPortal's Planner module for sales tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify your subdomain (no full URL) and API key are correct |
| Token expired | Generate a new token in Syncro and update the integration |
| Permissions error | Ensure all required permissions are enabled on the API token |
| Tickets not syncing | Check that ticket statuses aren't excluded in sync settings |
| Contacts not importing | Verify Auto-Import is enabled and a default role is selected in the Sync step |
| Devices not appearing | Ensure customers have been imported first, then trigger device import |
