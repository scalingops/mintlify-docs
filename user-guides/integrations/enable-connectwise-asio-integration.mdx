title: Enable ConnectWise Asio Integration
description: Step-by-step guide to set up ConnectWise Asio (RMM) integration with MSPortal for device monitoring and management
---

## Overview

ConnectWise Asio (formerly ConnectWise RMM) provides cloud-native remote monitoring and management capabilities. This integration enables MSPortal to sync devices, hypervisors, network devices, and company data from your Asio environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Admin access to ConnectWise Asio (RMM)
- Admin access to MSPortal
- Companies already imported from your PSA (ConnectWise Manage, Autotask, etc.)

<Note>
The Asio integration syncs devices to companies that already exist in MSPortal. Import your companies from your PSA integration first before setting up Asio.
</Note>

## Part 1: Configure ConnectWise Asio

### Step 1: Access API Settings

1. Login to ConnectWise Asio (RMM) as an Admin
2. Navigate to **Integrations > API Access**

### Step 2: Generate API Credentials

1. Click **Generate API Access** (or **+ Add** if you already have existing API keys)
2. Enter **API Key Name**: `MSPortal`
3. Configure the following scopes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Required API Scopes">
    | Scope | Permission |
    |-------|------------|
    | Platform - Agent | Read |
    | Platform - Assets | Read |
    | Platform - Companies | Read |
    | Platform - Custom Fields values | Read |
    | Platform - DataMapping | Read |
    | Platform - DeviceGroups | Read |
    | Platform - Devices | Read |
    | Platform - Sites | Read |
    | Platform - Tickets | Create |
    | Platform - Tickets | Read |
    | Platform - Tickets | Update |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

4. Click **Save** to generate the API credentials
5. **Important:** Copy the **API Key** and **API Secret** immediately - these cannot be retrieved again after closing the dialog

## Part 2: Connect MSPortal

### Step 1: Open Integration Settings

1. In MSPortal, navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Find **ConnectWise Asio** in the integrations list
3. Click **Configure**

### Step 2: Enter Credentials

In the connection dialog, enter your ConnectWise Asio API credentials:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **API Key** | The API key generated in Step 2 |
| **API Secret** | The API secret generated in Step 2 |

### Step 3: Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. You should see a green "Connected" indicator if successful.

If the connection fails:
- Verify your API Key and Secret are copied correctly
- Confirm all required scopes are enabled for the API key
- Check that your Asio account has admin privileges

### Step 4: Save the Integration

Click **Connect** to save the integration settings.

## Part 3: Map Companies

Before importing devices, you need to map your Asio companies to MSPortal companies.

### Step 1: Navigate to Company Import

1. Go to **Settings > Companies**
2. Click **Import**
3. Select **Import from ConnectWise Asio**

### Step 2: Map Companies

The import dialog displays companies from Asio alongside your existing MSPortal companies:

1. Review the company list from Asio
2. For each Asio company, select the corresponding MSPortal company to map it to
3. Click **Import** to save the mappings

<Tip>
Companies should already exist in MSPortal from your PSA integration (ConnectWise Manage, Autotask, etc.). The Asio import maps RMM companies to these existing companies rather than creating new ones.
</Tip>

---

## Part 4: Import Devices

After mapping companies, you can import devices from Asio.

<Warning>
Wait a few hours after mapping companies before importing devices. This allows the initial sync to complete and populate the staging area with device data.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Access Device Import

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Find the ConnectWise Asio integration
3. Click **Import Devices from Staging**

### Step 2: Review and Import

The import dialog displays devices that are ready to import:

- Only devices from mapped companies appear in the staging list
- Unmapped company devices are not shown until their companies are mapped
- Review the device list and click **Import** to add them to MSPortal

<Note>
Devices are continuously synced from Asio after the initial import. New devices will appear in the staging area as they are detected in your Asio environment.
</Note>

## What Gets Synced

| Data Type | Sync Direction | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Companies | Asio → MSPortal | Company/site information for mapping |
| Devices | Asio → MSPortal | Endpoints, workstations, and managed devices |
| Hypervisors | Asio → MSPortal | Virtual infrastructure hosts |
| Network Devices | Asio → MSPortal | Routers, switches, and network infrastructure |
| Device Groups | Asio → MSPortal | Device organization and grouping |
| Custom Fields | Asio → MSPortal | Custom field values assigned to devices |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify API Key and Secret are correct; ensure all required scopes are enabled |
| No companies in import list | Check that the API key has "Companies - Read" scope enabled |
| No devices in staging | Wait a few hours for initial sync; verify companies are mapped correctly |
| Devices missing for some companies | Ensure those companies are mapped in Settings > Companies |
| Permission errors | Verify your Asio account has admin privileges |

---

## Next Steps

After connecting Asio, you can:

- View synced devices in the **Devices** module
- Build reports using device data
- Set up compliance checks against your device inventory
- Monitor hypervisors and network devices alongside endpoints
