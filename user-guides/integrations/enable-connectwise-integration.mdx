## Part 2: Connect MSPortal

### Step 1: Open Integration Settings

1. In MSPortal, navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Find **ConnectWise Manage** in the integrations list
3. Click **Configure**

### Step 2: Enter Credentials

In the connection dialog, enter your ConnectWise API credentials:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **FQDN** | Your ConnectWise domain | `na.myconnectwise.net` or `aus.myconnectwise.net` |
| **Company ID** | Your company identifier (shown on login screen) | `YourCompanyID` |
| **Public Key** | API public key from Step 4 | `abc123...` |
| **Private Key** | API private key from Step 4 | `xyz789...` |

<Note>
**FQDN Examples:**
- Cloud-hosted: `na.myconnectwise.net`, `aus.myconnectwise.net`, `eu.myconnectwise.net`
- On-premise: `cw.yourcompany.com` (without https://)
</Note>

### Step 3: Test Connection

Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials. You should see a green "Connected" indicator if successful.

If the connection fails:
- Verify your FQDN is correct (no https:// prefix)
- Check that your Company ID matches exactly
- Confirm the API keys are copied correctly
- Ensure the API member has the correct security role assigned

### Step 4: Configure Sync Settings

After a successful connection test, click the **Sync Configuration** tab to customize what data syncs:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Skip Inactive Companies** | Only sync active companies (recommended) |
| **Exclude Company Types** | Select company types to exclude from sync |
| **Exclude Company Statuses** | Select company statuses to exclude from sync |
| **Exclude Opportunity Types** | Select opportunity types to exclude from sync |
| **Exclude Project Types** | Select project types to exclude from sync |

### Step 5: Complete Setup

Click **Connect** to save the integration and begin the initial sync.

## Next Steps

After connecting, you can configure additional settings:

- [Configure Service Desk Settings](./connectwise-configure-and-service-desk) - Set up ticket sync, boards, and statuses
- [Configure Opportunity Settings](./connectwise-opportunity-settings) - Set up opportunity sync and sales pipeline
- [Re-sync PSA Settings](./connectwise-resync-psa-settings) - Refresh configuration data from ConnectWise

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection test fails | Verify FQDN format, Company ID, and API keys are correct |
| Missing companies after sync | Check if company types or statuses are excluded in sync settings |
| Permission errors | Verify the API member has the MSPortal security role assigned |
| Sync not starting | Ensure the integration shows "Connected" status before syncing |

## Managing the Integration

To update credentials or sync settings after initial setup:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Manage** under ConnectWise Manage
3. Update settings as needed
4. Click **Save**

To disconnect the integration, click **Delete** in the manage dialog.
