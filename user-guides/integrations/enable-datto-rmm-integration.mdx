### Step 2: Map Sites

Map your Datto RMM sites to MSPortal companies. Only devices from mapped sites will be available for import.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for Initial Sync">
    After creating the integration, MSPortal begins syncing your sites from Datto RMM. This may take a few minutes depending on the number of sites.

    <Info>
    If you see "No sites found", wait a few minutes and refresh. The initial sync may take an hour or two to complete.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Site List">
    The mapping table displays all sites from Datto RMM with:
    - **Site Name**: The name of the site in Datto RMM
    - **Devices**: Number of devices at that site
    - **Mapped To**: The MSPortal company (if mapped)
    - **Confidence**: Matching confidence score (for auto-matched sites)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Quick Match (Recommended)">
    Click **Quick Match** to automatically map sites to companies with similar names. This uses fuzzy matching to find likely matches.

    - Sites matched with 70%+ confidence are automatically mapped
    - Review the results and adjust any incorrect mappings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manually Map Remaining Sites">
    For sites that weren't auto-matched:

    1. Find the site in the list
    2. Click the company dropdown in the "Mapped To" column
    3. Search for and select the correct MSPortal company
    4. The mapping is saved automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Unmap Sites (Optional)">
    To remove a mapping, click the **X** button next to the mapped company name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter the List">
    Use the filter dropdown to show:
    - **All Sites**: View all sites
    - **Mapped Only**: View only sites with company mappings
    - **Unmapped Only**: View sites that still need mapping
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You must map at least one site before proceeding to device import. Devices from unmapped sites will not appear in the import staging area.
</Warning>

---

### Step 3: Import Devices

After mapping sites, import devices from Datto RMM into your MSPortal asset inventory.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Device Import">
    Click **Open Device Import** to access the full device import interface. This opens a dedicated page for managing device imports.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click **Complete Setup** to finish the wizard. You can always return to the device import page later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 3: Device Import

The device import page lets you configure device type mappings and selectively import devices.

### Device Type Mappings

Before importing devices, map Datto device types to your MSPortal device types.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Discovered Types">
    The Device Type Mappings table shows all device types found in your Datto RMM:

    | Column | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Datto Category** | The device category (e.g., Desktop, Laptop, Server) |
    | **Datto Type** | The specific device type |
    | **Device Count** | Number of devices of this type |
    | **Maps To** | The MSPortal device type to map to |
    | **Auto-Sync** | Enable automatic import for this type |
    | **Actions** | Import all devices of this type |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Device Types">
    For each Datto device type:

    1. Click the "Maps To" dropdown
    2. Select the corresponding MSPortal device type
    3. The mapping is saved automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Auto-Sync (Optional)">
    Check the **Auto-Sync** checkbox for device types you want automatically imported. New devices of these types will be imported without manual intervention.

    <Note>
    Auto-sync requires a device type mapping. You must select a "Maps To" value before enabling auto-sync.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import by Type">
    Click **Import All** on a row to import all unimported devices of that type at once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Staged Devices

The Staged Devices table shows devices ready for import from mapped sites.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger a Sync">
    Click **Sync Now** in the page header to fetch the latest devices from Datto RMM.

    <Info>
    The initial sync may take an hour or two to complete. Subsequent syncs are faster.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Staged Devices">
    The table displays:
    - **Device Name**: Hostname of the device
    - **Category/Type**: Datto device classification
    - **Site**: Which Datto site the device belongs to
    - **Company**: The mapped MSPortal company
    - **Status**: Whether the device has been imported
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Devices">
    Toggle **Show only unimported** to hide devices that have already been imported.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select and Import">
    1. Check the boxes next to devices you want to import
    2. Click **Import Selected** to import the selected devices
    3. Imported devices will be created in your MSPortal asset inventory
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For bulk imports, use the device type mapping's "Import All" button instead of selecting individual devices.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Map Sites First" icon="sitemap">
    Always map your Datto sites to companies before trying to import devices. Unmapped site devices won't appear in staging.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Quick Match" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Start with Quick Match for site mapping, then manually adjust any incorrect matches. It saves significant time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable Auto-Sync" icon="rotate">
    For device types you always want imported (like workstations), enable Auto-Sync to reduce manual work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regular Syncs" icon="clock">
    Run manual syncs periodically if you're not using auto-sync, especially after adding new devices in Datto.
  </Card>
