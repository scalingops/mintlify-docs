## Why aren't my tickets syncing?

If your tickets aren't appearing in MSPortal, check these common issues:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import Companies First">
    Tickets are linked to companies. Before tickets can sync, you must import your companies from your PSA.

    Go to **Settings > Companies** and ensure your companies have been imported. See the [Import Companies guide](/user-guides/integrations/import-companies) for detailed instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Queues to Sync">
    Open your PSA integration settings and configure the **Ticket Settings**. You must select which ticket queues/boards to sync.

    - **ConnectWise**: Select Service Boards in Ticket Settings
    - **Autotask**: Select Queues in Ticket Settings
    - **Halo PSA**: Select Ticket Types in Ticket Settings
    - **Syncro**: Tickets sync automatically once the integration is connected
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Integration Status">
    Ensure your PSA integration shows as **Active** on the Integrations page (`/settings/integrations`).

    If the status shows as disconnected or errored, your API credentials may have expired or been revoked. Reconnect the integration with fresh credentials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
After making configuration changes, use the **Sync Now** button on your integration card to trigger an immediate sync rather than waiting for the scheduled sync.
</Tip>

## How often do syncs happen?

MSPortal syncs data from your integrations on regular schedules:

| Data Type | Sync Frequency | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Tickets** | Every 15 minutes | Incremental sync of recent changes |
| **Companies & Contacts** | Every 30 minutes | Full sync of company data |
| **Users & Resources** | Every 30 minutes | PSA technicians and resources |
| **PSA Reference Data** | Every 30 minutes | Ticket types, priorities, statuses, etc. |
| **Devices (RMM)** | Every 30 minutes | Device inventory from Datto, Asio, Syncro |
| **Microsoft 365 Secure Score** | Every 30 minutes | Security posture metrics |

<Info>
**Autotask Webhooks**: If you've enabled webhooks for your Autotask integration, ticket updates are received in near real-time rather than waiting for the scheduled sync.
</Info>

## I made a change in my PSA and it's not showing up

Changes made in your PSA will appear in MSPortal after the next scheduled sync (typically within 15-30 minutes depending on data type).

If you need the changes immediately:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Wait for Auto-Sync" icon="clock">
    Tickets sync every 15 minutes; other data syncs every 30 minutes. Simply wait for the next sync cycle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Force Manual Sync" icon="rotate">
    Click the **refresh icon** on your integration card at `/settings/integrations` to trigger an immediate sync.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Manual syncs are rate-limited. If you've recently triggered a sync, you may need to wait a few minutes before triggering another.
</Warning>

## My integration shows as disconnected

If your integration status shows as disconnected or has an error:

1. **Check API Credentials** - API keys or secrets may have expired or been rotated in your PSA
2. **Verify Permissions** - Ensure the API user has the required permissions (see integration-specific guides)
3. **Check Rate Limits** - Some PSAs have API rate limits that may temporarily block requests
4. **Reconnect** - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration with fresh credentials
