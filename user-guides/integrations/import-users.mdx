---

This guide explains how to import users from your integrations into MSPortal.ai. The import process is consistent across all supported integrations, allowing you to bring in team members individually or in bulk.

## Supported Integrations

MSPortal.ai supports importing users from the following integrations:

| Integration | User Type |
|-------------|-----------|
| ConnectWise Manage | Members (Users) |
| Halo PSA | Agents |
| Autotask PSA | Resources |
| Syncro | Technicians |
| Microsoft 365 | Users |

<Note>
The import process is the same regardless of which integration you use. The screenshots in this guide show ConnectWise Manage, but the steps apply to all integrations.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- At least one integration must be configured and active
- User roles must be created in MSPortal.ai
- You must have the **Manage Users** permission

## Import Users from Settings

### 1. Navigate to Users & Roles Settings

Go to **Settings** → **Users & Roles** in the main navigation.

### 3. Review Available Users

The import dialog displays all users from your integration. You'll see:
- User name and email address
- Job title (if available)
- Last sync date
- Link status (whether already linked to an MSPortal.ai user)

### 4. Select Users to Import

Select users to import by:
- Clicking individual checkboxes to select users one by one
- Using the header checkbox to select all unlinked users
- Using the search box to filter users by name or email

<Tip>
Use the **Show Unlinked Only** button to filter the list to users who haven't been imported yet.
</Tip>

### 5. Link to Existing Users (Optional)

For users who already exist in MSPortal.ai (such as your admin account):

1. Find the user in the list
2. Click the **Link User** dropdown in that row
3. Select the matching MSPortal.ai user
4. This links the integration record to the existing account instead of creating a duplicate

### 6. Select a Role

Choose the MSPortal.ai role to assign to all imported users using the **Role for imported users** dropdown.

### 7. Add Missing Email Addresses

<Warning>
All users must have email addresses to be imported. Users without email addresses cannot be selected.
</Warning>

If a user lacks an email address:

1. Find the user in the list (they'll have an empty email input field)
2. Enter their email address in the **Email** field
3. The email will be saved with their MSPortal.ai account

### 8. Complete the Import

1. Review the number of selected users shown on the **Import Selected** button
2. Click **Import Selected**
3. Wait for the confirmation message
4. Imported users will appear in your Users list

## Post-Import Tasks

After importing users:

- **Verify roles**: Confirm imported users have the correct roles and permissions
- **Send welcome emails**: If not done during import, send login credentials manually
- **Configure preferences**: Set up any user-specific settings
- **Enable 2FA**: Set up two-factor authentication for admin users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Missing users** | Verify your integration has proper API permissions and the users are active in the source system |
| **Email required error** | All users must have valid email addresses. Add email addresses using the input field in the list |
| **Role not selected** | Select a role from the dropdown before clicking Import |
| **Duplicate user error** | The user may already exist. Use the **Link User** feature to connect accounts |
| **Cannot select user** | The user is either already linked or missing an email address |
