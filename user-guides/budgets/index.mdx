## Adding Budget Line Items

The budget builder provides three panels for importing items into your budget:

### Planner Items

Import items directly from your company Planner. Each planner item shows:
- Task name and icon
- Due date and status
- Estimated cost (if set)

Click the **+** button next to any planner item to add it as a budget line item.

### Products and Services

Add products from your PSA or manually created products. Products display:
- Product name
- SKU (if available)
- Vendor
- Category
- Unit price

Toggle the **all** checkbox to see products from all tenants or just the current company.

### Strategic Goals

Link strategic goals to your budget for alignment with company objectives. Goals show:
- Goal title
- Priority badge (High, Medium, Low)
- Target date and status

<Tip>
Linking goals to budget items helps demonstrate how IT spending supports strategic business objectives during budget reviews.
