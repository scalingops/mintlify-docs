## Best Practices

<Check>
- Create budgets well before the fiscal year begins
- Link budgets to strategic goals for alignment visibility
- Use categories to organize line items by type
- Update line item statuses as approvals are received
- Export PDF versions for client presentations
- Use **Obsolete** status for superseded budgets rather than deleting them
- Review all line items before approving a budget (approval is permanent)
- Use recurring items with term months for subscriptions to calculate annualized costs
</Check>

<Warning>
Avoid these common pitfalls:
- **Approving too early** - Once approved, budgets cannot be edited; ensure all items are finalized
- Creating budgets without linking to planner items or goals
- Leaving budgets in Draft status indefinitely
- Not updating line item statuses after approval decisions
- Deleting budgets instead of marking them Obsolete for audit trails
- Forgetting to set recurrence and term for subscription items
</Warning>
