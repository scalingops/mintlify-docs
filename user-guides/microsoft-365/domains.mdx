The summary section displays four key metrics about your domains:

| Metric | Description |

| **Total Domains** | Number of registered domains across all companies |
| **Verified** | Number of verified domains with percentage |
| **Default Domain** | The primary domain for your organization |
| **Companies** | Number of companies with M365 domains configured |

## Domains Table

### Table Columns

The domains table displays all registered domains with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Domain** | Domain name with indicators for default and initial domains |
| **Company** | Associated company (visible in global view) |
| **Default** | Whether this is the default domain for the tenant |
| **Verified** | Domain verification status |
| **Services** | Microsoft 365 services enabled for the domain |
| **Auth Type** | Authentication type (Managed or Federated) |

### Domain Indicators

Domains may display special indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Star icon** | This is the default domain for the tenant |
| **Initial badge** | This is the initial `.onmicrosoft.com` domain |

### Verification Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Verified** | Domain ownership has been confirmed via DNS records |
| **Unverified** | Domain is registered but not yet verified |

<Note>
Unverified domains cannot be used for email or other Microsoft 365 services until verification is complete.
</Note>

### Authentication Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Managed** | Authentication handled directly by Microsoft 365 |
| **Federated** | Authentication handled by an external identity provider (e.g., ADFS) |

### Services

The Services column shows which Microsoft 365 services are enabled for each domain:

- **Email** - Exchange Online email routing
- **OfficeCommunicationsOnline** - Microsoft Teams and Skype
- **Intune** - Device management
- **SharePoint** - SharePoint Online sites

If a domain has more than three services, a badge shows the count of additional services.

### Sorting and Filtering

- **Sort** - Click any column header to sort the table
- **Search** - Use the search box to find specific domains
- **Company Filter** - Multi-select dropdown to filter by one or more companies
- **Default Filter** - Filter to show only default or non-default domains
- **Verified Filter** - Filter by verification status
- **Auth Type Filter** - Filter by authentication type

### Exporting Data

Users with the **manage_m365** permission can export domain data:

1. Click the **Export** button in the table toolbar
2. Choose your export format
3. The export includes domain name, company, verification status, authentication type, and services

## Company Context

The domains view adapts based on your current context:

| View | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Global View** | Shows domains from all companies, Company column visible |
| **Company View** | Shows domains for the selected company only |

Switch between views using the company selector in the main navigation.

## Prerequisites

Before using M365 Domains:

1. **Microsoft 365 Integration** - Enable in Settings > Integrations for each company
2. **Azure AD Permissions** - The integration requires appropriate Graph API permissions
3. **User Permissions** - Requires access to the M365 module

## Troubleshooting

### Domains Not Showing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No domains appear in the table">
    **Possible causes:**
    - M365 integration not configured for any companies
    - Integration credentials expired or invalid
    - Initial sync has not completed

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify M365 integration is active in Settings > Integrations
    2. Wait for the automatic sync to complete
    3. Check integration permissions in Azure AD
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Domain shows as unverified">
    **Possible causes:**
    - DNS verification records not configured
    - DNS propagation not complete
    - Verification record removed

    **Solution:**
    1. Check DNS records in your domain registrar
    2. Verify TXT or MX records match Microsoft requirements
    3. Allow up to 72 hours for DNS propagation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services column shows unexpected values">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Domain not configured for all services
    - Service configuration changed in Microsoft 365

    **Solution:**
    1. Review domain configuration in Microsoft 365 admin center
    2. Wait for automatic sync to update the data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Domain Management

1. **Verify Custom Domains** - Ensure all custom domains are verified to enable full functionality
2. **Review Default Domain** - Confirm the correct domain is set as default for each tenant
3. **Monitor Authentication** - Track federated vs. managed authentication for security auditing

### Regular Monitoring

- **Monthly** - Review domain verification status across all companies
- **Quarterly** - Audit domain authentication types and service configurations
- **As Needed** - Check domains when adding new companies or tenants
