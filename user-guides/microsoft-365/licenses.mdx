## Licenses Table

### Table Columns

The licenses table displays all your Microsoft 365 licenses with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **License** | License name and SKU part number |
| **Company** | Associated company (visible in global view) |
| **Used** | Number of licenses currently assigned |
| **Available** | Total licenses purchased |
| **Utilization** | Visual progress bar showing usage percentage |
| **Status** | License status (Enabled, Warning, Suspended, etc.) |

### Utilization Indicators

The utilization progress bar is color-coded to help identify licenses that may need attention:

| Color | Utilization | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Green** | Below 75% | Healthy utilization |
| **Yellow** | 75% - 89% | Approaching capacity |
| **Red** | 90% or above | Near or at capacity |

### Quick Filters

Use the quick filter buttons above the table to focus on relevant licenses:

- **Free/Trial** - Toggle to show or hide free and trial licenses (hidden by default)
- **10k+ Units** - Toggle to show or hide licenses with 10,000 or more units (hidden by default)

Each filter button displays a badge showing how many items are currently hidden.

<Note>
Hiding free/trial and large allocation licenses helps you focus on paid licenses that require active management.

## Best Practices

### License Optimization

1. **Review High Utilization** - Licenses at 90%+ may need additional purchases
2. **Identify Unused Licenses** - Low utilization licenses may be candidates for reallocation
3. **Monitor Warnings** - Address licenses in Warning or Suspended status promptly

### Regular Monitoring

- **Weekly** - Review utilization trends for high-value licenses
- **Monthly** - Audit license assignments across companies
- **Quarterly** - Comprehensive license optimization review

### Data Freshness

- Sync data regularly to maintain accurate utilization metrics
- Schedule syncs after major user provisioning or deprovisioning events
- Check the "Last synced" timestamp in license details for data currency
