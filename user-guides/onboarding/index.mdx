## Key Features

### Onboarding Templates

Build reusable onboarding templates in **Settings > Onboarding**. Templates can include:

- **Phases** to organize tasks into logical groups (e.g., "Discovery", "Setup", "Go-Live")
- **Task types**: document uploads, credential handoffs, surveys, meetings, checklists, approvals, and signatures
- **Dependencies** between tasks so they unlock in the right order
- **Automated emails** to invite clients and send reminders

### Client Portal

Each onboarding generates a personalized, branded portal for your client. Clients can:

- View their onboarding progress across all phases
- Complete assigned tasks (upload files, fill out surveys, submit credentials)
- See what's coming next and what's waiting on your team
- Access the portal securely via an emailed magic link — no account creation needed

### Admin Dashboard

Manage all onboardings from the company's onboarding tab:

- Track progress across all phases and tasks
- View submitted documents and survey responses
- Reveal credentials securely (one-time access)
- Add comments and communicate with your team
- Bulk-complete internal tasks
