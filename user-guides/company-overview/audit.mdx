## Summary Cards

At the top of the page, four summary cards provide an instant overview of company health:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Companies** | The total number of companies in your tenant |
| **Well Configured** | Companies with an audit score of 80% or higher (shown in green) |
| **Needs Attention** | Companies with an audit score between 60-79% (shown in yellow) |
| **Critical** | Companies with an audit score below 60% (shown in red) |

<Tip>Focus on companies in the "Critical" category first to ensure all clients have proper configurations in place.</Tip>

## Understanding Audit Scores

The audit score is calculated based on multiple factors that indicate how well a company is configured in MSPortal.ai:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Company roles assigned | 10 |
| QBR schedule configured | 10 |
| Users linked | 8 |
| Locations configured | 8 |
| Devices tracked | 8 |
| Upcoming planner items | 5 |
| Upcoming compliance checks | 5 |
| Budget configured | 5 |
| Integrations active | 5 |

<Note>A higher score indicates better configuration. Scores are displayed with color-coded progress bars: green (80%+), yellow (60-79%), and red (below 60%).</Note>
