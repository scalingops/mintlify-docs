## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Monitoring">
    Start your day on the Global view to identify companies needing immediate attention. Look for overdue compliance checks, open tickets, and upcoming planner items.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Company Check-ins">
    Before client meetings, switch to that company's view to review their current status across all modules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Priority Focus">
    Widgets highlight high-priority items. Address red/urgent indicators first before moving to routine tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Quick Navigation">
    Click directly into items from widgets to take action. This is faster than navigating through menus.
